Carlos P. Romulo	UNGA 1	"Peace is not built with words. Peace must be written in the human heart.

We are not here to make the peace, but to build for peace. We are not here to avenge the injuries of the past, but to fulfil humanity's hopes for the future. We are not here to reap and divide the harvest of victory, but to make ready the hearts and minds of men for the seeds of peace.

The agenda before us outlines the shape and magnitude of our task. It reflects the infinite variety of the problems that are involved in planning for the future peace and progress of the world. To the prompt and successful completion of this task, I pledge the enthusiastic cooperation of the Philippine delegation. We represent a nation that was recently born to the recovered freedom of the post-war world, the first-born State of the atomic age. The Philippine Republic is both consanguineous and coeval with the United Nations. The blood that the Filipino people shed for their freedom was shed likewise for the common victory. Their stake in the United Nations is the stake of an identical destiny, of shared anxiety and of hope and endeavour.

By the circumstances of our birth as a free and independent State, we are committed to the aims and purposes of the United Nations. The Philippine Republic has been the first beneficiary of the triumph of democracy. It has been established under a constitution which renounces war as an instrument of national policy. It is the child of the marriage of the East and the West, heir to the traditional ways and aspirations of the one and to the social and political institutions of the other. Our country may thus be regarded as a bridge between two worlds, among the first of many that must be erected to make them one.

I speak of two worlds, and I speak of a division that is more than merely geographical. It is an easy matter to look at the globe and indicate the longitudes that separate the East from the West. Here, one might say, are the lands of Asia, the Near East and Africa, inhabited by peoples belonging to a great diversity of races and cultural patterns. And here are the lands of Europe and the Americas, inhabited by peoples of related stock whose cultural pattern is, in the main, homogeneous.

But geography and race alone do not explain the bifurcation of the world. Nor does culture by itself explain it, since culture is essentially an end-product of the historical process. We have two worlds today because one of them has fallen under the economic and political domination of the other. The line that separates these two worlds is not the vertical wall of racial or cultural dissimilarity, but the horizontal barrier of economic and political inequality.

The Economic and Social Council has, during its recent session, devoted a great deal of attention to the economic reconstruction of devastated areas. The Philippine Republic took part in the study of this problem. We urged then, and we urge today, that the mere restoration of what has been destroyed does not answer the basic needs of the Philippines and of the other countries of Asia and the Far East. Most of the peoples in those parts of the world have for many centuries lived at submarginal economic levels. What they need today is not reconstruction only, but construction as well, not merely the restitution of a destroyed economy but the institution of a new and progressive one.

It is customary to deprecate the low standard of living and political backwardness of the peoples of the East as if these were a matter of fate or predestination. We, of course, know better. We know that many of the countries of Asia are enormously rich in natural resources and that these resources, if properly exploited and developed in the interests of the native peoples, would elevate the standards of living there to levels as high as those of the peoples of the West.

We trust that this General Assembly and the various other instrumentalities and agencies of the United Nations will regard the discovery and application of the appropriate remedies to these conditions as one of their gravest concerns. There can be no peace in a world that is permanently divided between nations that produce raw materials and nations that process these materials into finished products. This is not the sort of economic interdependence among the nations which we all envision. The interdependence we seek must be a balanced and reciprocal relationship.

The political implications of industrialization are no mystery to anyone. Industrialization is the handmaiden not only of economic progress but of political liberty.

In the conference held last year in San Francisco, it was our privilege to help write into the Charter of the United Nations the principle that any nation which assumes responsibilities for the administration of Non-Self-Governing Territories accepts ""as a sacred trust"" the obligation, among others, to ensure the political, economic, social and educational advancement of the inhabitants of those territories, and to develop self-government, take due account of their political aspirations, and assist them in the progressive development of their free political institutions. This was a noble declaration, marking a new era in the history of colonization. We realize very well that its force is largely moral. But there is much, during the past year, to encourage the hope that it was more than a declaration of good intentions. During that period the Philippines became independent. India is today on the road to freedom. We feel confident that the situation in Indonesia and Indo-China will continue to improve under the influence of this declaration as a statement of principle which carries with it the force of world opinion.

Moreover, the organization of the Trusteeship Council is now happily in prospect. Although the success of the trusteeship system will depend primarily upon the good will and sense of responsibility of the administering authority, it is encouraging to realize that the treatment of Trust Territories will henceforth be subject to the scrutiny of the conscience of the world. Let no nation, however powerful, repudiate its responsibility with respect to Trust Territories under the Charter.

The Philippine delegation regards as inadequate the provisions of the Charter regarding the implementation of the principles enunciated in Chapter XI, and will propose in due time the formation of a Regional Conference for Non-Self-Governing Peoples. The millions who would not remain silent any longer will be voiceless no more; they will have a voice, and their voice, whenever raised in the name of freedom, shall be heard.

The voice that is raised in the name of freedom must be free. Because we of the Philippine delegation sincerely believe that freedom of information is essential to the maintenance of peace, we have proposed the holding of an international press conference to discuss methods of ensuring the unimpeded transmission of news throughout the world.

We are aware of the difficulties that stand in the way of this objective. It has been asked, for instance, whether the press, the radio and the movies are equal to the responsibilities of freedom. The question is not born of spite, for these media of information can be controlled, and not only by the police of a despotic State; they can be controlled by powerful elements even in a State avowedly democratic. They can be polluted not only by prejudice but by motives of pecuniary profit and political advantage.

The press, the radio and the movies, to be free, must not only be able to operate without fetters; they must be inwardly free of corrupting motives and self-limiting prejudices. The proposed press conference shall concern itself with these two aspects of freedom of information. The freedom of inquiry and transmission must be safeguarded by compensating guarantees of honesty and responsibility. Only in this way can these media of information become instrumental in the maintenance of peace.

It is our hope that the holding of such a conference will be approved by the General Assembly and that the appropriate agreements may soon be drawn uppossibly in collaboration with the Human Rights Commission of the Economic and Social Councilwith a view to the elimination of the barriers of censorship which encourage malicious propaganda and breed distrust.

Distrust is the one thing that we can least afford to cultivate at this stage of our work. I must express our extreme gratification with the atmosphere of tolerance and good will which has so far pervaded the deliberations of this Assembly. We have agreed, thanks to the gracious forbearance of the Soviet delegation, to place upon the agenda the various proposals to modify the Charter provision on the veto privilege of the big Powers in the Security Council.

No issue will probably be more passionately debated by this Assembly than the question of the veto. There are, as we have seen, powerful arguments on both sides. The Philippine Republic is one of the small nations, and our sympathies are entirely in favour of limiting this privilege to the extent that it will not continually obstruct our efforts towards peaceful agreement and fruitful co-operation. At the same time, we have no illusions regarding the practicability, at the present moment, of establishing absolute voting equality among the nations of the world. In the League of Nations, you will recall, a system was tried under which each Member could, by its own choice, will itself out of an agreement. There was absolute equality there, but the results were negative. In the United Nations Security Council, only five nations enjoy this privilege, with the difference that there can be no agreement at all except with their unanimous consent.

There has been some improvement. Yet this is not democracy, any more than the absolute voting equality between big nations and small is true democracy. Until we are able to establish a world government based upon proportional representation, there will be valid argument for the veto.

It is the contention of the Philippine delegation that a compromise between these two positions is not only necessary, but possible. It is necessary in order to enlarge the area of agreement in the Security Council, and to enable that body to perform the vital functions that have been entrusted to it. It is possible provided we shall see more and more, from now on, of that spirit of tolerance and good will which has given such an auspicious colour to our deliberations. Peace is not made with words. Peace is won by numbers. The fifty-one nations represented here are not our sum total. In summing up our forces, we must not overlook the roll-call of the dead, the twenty million men of all nations who died in the past cataclysm within the space of six years. And they are not all. Watching with us are the uncounted millions of mute and unrepresented peoples of Asia and Africa. They too ask the right to live. There are more. There will be more.

What of those who survived, whose ranks are beyond number, who are dying from within spiritually, as surely as men die from within after the shock of atomic bombs? They are the sufferers of war's residue of hatred, suspicion and cynicism. They are not here; we must speak for them.

Around us, and making merry at our expense, are the money-changers, the hired destroyers of hope, the professional haters of humanity, the rented jesters of those who deny the survival rights of the common man. Their voices are loud. Their power is great. But if destruction comes, their cries will be no louder than our own, and their children and ours will die together.

The dead, the living and the yet unborn are our conscience. We speak for them. Our responsibility is not for this hour, nor for this day, nor for tomorrow. We must plan for all the tomorrows, we must build peace forever, for one world, indivisible. We have not long in which to build.

The Nagasaki blast is the story foretold in Revelation of the breaking of the sixth seal. Let us remember that Bible prophecy: ""When the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, shall hide themselves in the dens and the rocks of the mountains."" We have seen that prophecy brought to pass in lands we thought civilized and safe. We saw it happen in England, Germany, France, Italy, Japan and in the Philippines.

The Philippine Republic is the world's newest nation. We are taking our place in a world that has not made up its mind to live or die. We ask to live. We fought to live. We of the Philippine Republic reject cynicism as the underground refuge of the cowardly and a repudiation of the dignity of human life. In this past war, it was a source of both grief and honour to me to know the simple, honest soldier, brown or black or white, who gave all he had to givehis lifebecause he believed that aggression is an arch crime against mankind. We dare not be less honest than he. Under the falling bombs men open their hearts. They speak with honesty in the face of death. We are all under attack, although it may seem impossible to conceive. Danger is in the skies, and every man on the face of the earth who knows enough to be afraid, walks in fear. Now is the time for an honest opening of hearts and minds. Frank discussion is safer than hidden bitterness. It is the only thing that can save us now.

By nature, and by the experience of suffering, the Philippine Republic is dedicated to the ideals that first brought together our fifty-one nations and to the programme of the United Nations, conceived as an instrument of military victory and perpetuated as an instrument to win the peace. It won the fight. It can win the peace. Ours is the solemn responsibility to grant or to deny humanity its right to live. May we who are gathered here today prove equal to this responsibility and to the sovereign promise of the United Nations."	1946-10-29
Carlos P. Romulo	UNGA 2	"I bring to this Assembly the greetings and cordial felicitations of His Excellency, the President of the Philippines, General Manuel Roxas.


We are confronted during the present session of the General Assembly with a multitude of grave problems. It is not necessary, I am sure, to inspire in us the sense of earnest dedication which the occasion requires. We have arrived at a crucial moment in the life of the United Nations and in the history of mankind. The task before us is both an opportunity and a challenge, and the manner in which this Assembly will meet it may well prove to be the measure of our success in tiding humanity over the engulfing crisis toward better times.


In the face of the insecurity and violence which afflict so many parts of the world today, it would be difficult to dissemble and most unwise to deceive ourselves. Men everywhere await with anxiety the balm of the peace that is still to be made. Peace which in due course should have been the fruit of our common victory continues to lie beyond our reach. What men feel today is something compounded of impatience and fearimpatience with the slow progress that has been achieved in promoting confidence and cooperation among nations, and fear of the final disaster that would attend the failure of our present efforts.


One year ago, or two years ago, it was much easier to minimize the social and economic disorganization of many countries and the political conflicts and rivalries between various States by considering these conditions as the inevitable aftermath of war. Today we can no longer seek solace in that attitude. It has become clear that we are now faced not simply with the disorganization which normally follows war, but with a calculated confusion which, in the past, has usually led to war.


Fortunately, the situation is not without its redeeming aspects. For the long and heavy agenda of the current session accurately reflects the universal anxiety over the deterioration of the social, economic and political conditions of humanity, the general desire to hasten the improvement of these conditions, andwhat is even more significantmans abiding faith in the United Nations as the chosen instrument for effecting such improvement.


It would be impossible to dwell on the threat of failure which hangs over the Organization without reference to the veto power of the permanent members of the Security Council. It is not an exaggeration to affirm that the entire structure of the United Nations Organization must at some time crumble and collapse under the continued sledgehammer blows of the veto. One can make this affirmationeven those among us who have been fighting the veto since San Franciscowithout excitement or passion. Quite calmly and deliberately, we say that the world must choose between the United Nations and the veto in its present form. We cannot have both. We may soon have neither.


Let the record speak for itself: twenty-two vetoes in the space of two years, twenty of them by only one of the permanent members of the Security Council. Through crisis after crisis, the Security Council has been stalemated into virtual inaction. On the Greek question, on the incidents in the Corfu Channel, on the proposals for atomic control, on the Dutch-Indonesian conflicteven on the question of admitting new Members to the United Nationscertain permanent members of the Security Council have seen fit to exercise their privilege of the veto to prevent decisions calculated to promote international cooperation for the maintenance of peace.


In opposing the principle of the veto, my Government is moved by no desire to question the well-merited preponderance of the five permanent Members in the councils of the United Nations. But my country does deny the right of any one of these five States to condemn so important an organ of the United Nations as the Security Council to a condition of permanent paralysis.


The main objection to the veto is not that it has been used too often by one of the permanent members. It is rather that the veto is a weapon which any one of the five permanent members may wield, as we have seen it wielded by one other permanent member, whenever such action suits its own conception of its national interest. From this example, it is obvious that the veto does not encourage unanimity; it encourages rather the adoption of rigid attitudes and unalterable positions and is bound to result in a condition of alternating challenge and defiance.


The principle of unanimity cannot be established by fiat. It can only spring from an inward discipline which is strong enough to dissuade the permanent members from acting on the impulse of naked self-interest, inspired on the one hand by the foreknowledge of substantial majorities, or on the other by the certainty of defeat. Such discipline cannot grow so long as each of the permanent members knows that it has always close at hand the invincible weapon that is the veto. Modify the veto, place it beyond reach and use, except for extraordinary and justifiable occasions, and you open the road towards the methods of compromise and adjustment which constitute the discipline of which I have spoken.


In accordance with these views, my Government would support every reasonable proposal to limit or regulate the exercise of the vetoif possible by measures voluntarily accepted by the permanent members, or if necessary by appropriate amendments to Article 27 of the Charter.


It used to be said of the opposition to the veto that it was instigated by and solely in the interest of the smaller Powers. Although this may have been true in the beginningin San Francisco and then later, last year in New Yorkit is not so any more. The permanent members themselves are no longer unanimous on the principle of unanimity. We heard with satisfaction the Secretary of State of the United States affirm before the Assembly yesterday that the United States would be willing to consider measures for the liberalization of the voting procedure in the Security Council indefinitely.


The issue is not just overuse by one member. The veto is a weapon that any permanent member can wield, as others have done, to suit national interests. It does not foster unity; it entrenches rigid stances and leads to defiance and impasse.


True unanimity cannot be imposed; it must arise from self-disciplinestrong enough to prevent members from acting out of self-interest. Such discipline cannot exist while each permanent member clings to the invincible veto. Limiting the vetoreserving it only for extraordinary circumstanceswould open the way to compromise and real diplomacy.


Thus, the Philippine Government supports every reasonable effort to regulate the veto, whether through voluntary restraint or amendments to Article 27 of the Charter.


Once, veto opposition was attributed solely to small powers. That is no longer true. Even the permanent members no longer speak in unison. We welcomed the United States Secretary of States willingness to revise the veto in matters under Chapter VI and membership applications. These proposals deserve thoughtful consideration. Let other permanent members step forward with their own ideas and show their commitment to resolving this grave concern.


In recent months, various initiatives have emerged that, in effect, bypass the United Nations. This trend is regrettable, yet we cannot condemn it if we, through obstruction or veto, block every meaningful solution. Stalemates solve nothing. If the United Nations fails to act, the world will turn to alternatives that the veto cannot stop.


This is the heart of the matter: either empower the Security Council by reforming the veto or render it impotent, forcing the world to rely on external mechanisms that may ultimately undermine the Organization.


The Councils inaction on vital issues has increased the Assemblys burden. The General Assembly remains free of the veto and is responsive to world opinion. However, it lacks the Councils binding authority and is not in continuous session.


The United States has proposed an interim committee on peace and security. The Philippines supports this, as it is feasible under the Charter and would ease the Assemblys workload between sessions.


Still, the challenge of strengthening the Assembly's authority remains. Decisionssuch as on Indias complaint against South Africa or calls for metropolitan powers to consult non-self-governing peopleshave not always been faithfully observed. Ignoring the Assemblys will is no less condemnable than abusing the veto. In fact, morally, it may be worse. Thus, we call upon Member States to consider appropriate measures to address noncompliance.


We also welcome the establishment of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. While its early work is promising, we remain cautious, especially after seeing the Commission for Europe suspended, with its work overtaken by another entity. Will Asias Commission share the same fate? We may find out when it meets in Baguio later this year.


Similarly, the new Economic Commission for Latin America gives hope for effective cooperation under UN auspices, as it should be.


We are encouraged by the creation of the Trusteeship Council and the apparent goodwill of administering powers to fulfill their obligations. Still, a disparity remains. Non-Self-Governing Territories are not receiving the same political advancement as Trust Territories. I urge Members to review the records of the Ad Hoc Committee led by New Zealands Sir Carl Berendsen, which examined reports under Article 73e of the Charter.


The findings are sobering. They reveal a reluctance among some powers to acknowledge the right of colonized peoples to freedom and independencea dangerous delusion in this enlightened age.


Yet, there are signs of hope: the creation of India and Pakistan, discussions on Palestines independence, greater self-rule for Burma and Ceylon, and the U.S. pledge to address Koreas independence. These are signs of freedoms unstoppable advance.


We commend the U.S. and the U.K. for applying the same democratic principles abroad that have shaped their own national greatness.


Freedom may lie dormant, but it never dies. In Asia or Africa, it will grow, eventually overcoming economic exploitation, political control, or military force.


Recent examples of states voluntarily relinquishing power have inspired the oppressed. The question now is whether others will follow suit peacefullyor risk the bloodshed seen elsewhere. The peaceful path exists. The U.S. showed it in the Philippines. Other powers have done the same. This peaceful path must become the norm.


As we open this session, we face immense challenges. We may feel overwhelmed or inspired to act with the tools available to us. Our agenda proves the worlds desperate longing for freedom, peace, and social progress.


Some say the United Nations cannot solve all of humanitys problems. We of the Philippines disagree. The danger lies not in bringing our burdens to the UN, but in two failures: failing to give the UN the authority it needs, and failing to assign it the tasks it is chartered to carry out.


The road is long and hard, but we are not discouraged. With patience, goodwill, and faith in our shared purpose, we will find agreement. We will overcome todays deep anxieties and dispel the looming fear of disaster that haunts our troubled world."	1947-09-18
Carlos P. Romulo	UNGA 3	"For the past several weeks, the city of Berlin has been the focus of mens fears. Today, and for the duration of this session of the General Assembly, the city of Paris will be the centre of mens hopes. Our meeting coincides with a turning point in history. We are called upon to decide the momentous issues of our time; whether we shall have war or peace; whether man shall live in larger freedom or under increasing regimentation; whether the nations shall eventually unite into a single community of peoples under a world charter, or divide permanently into armed and hostile camps governed only by the predatory laws of the jungle.


These, in essence, are the problems that confront us. They involve the fate of every man, woman, and child now living as well as of generations yet unborn. There is something supremely ironic and yet touching in the way by which events have persisted in demonstrating the world's need for the United Nations. Every international problem that has defied solution by individual states has come before us, as to a court of last appealthe problems of atomic energy, Greece, Iran, Egypt, South Africa, Korea, Indonesia, Kashmir, Palestine, Czechoslovakia, the former Italian Colonies, and perhaps, before we adjourn, the gravest and most difficult problem of all, the quarrel of the great powers over Germany.


Inadequate as its efforts have often proved to be, hampered by indifference and sometimes by a deliberate intent to thwart its efforts, the United Nations yet remains as mankinds chief and perhaps its last hope for universal peace, freedom and security. It is an experience at once humbling and inspiring to realize that we represent at this moment the only force that can stand between the peoples of the world and the catastrophe that threatens to engulf them. May this thought guide and sustain us as we begin this crucial session of the General Assembly.


War is the great, the overriding problem before us. The danger is no longer remote or hypothetical. It is real, and it grows with every passing hour. War is on the march in Asia. It chafes angrily under the uneasy truce of Palestine and stalks with iron tread the Continent of Europe. We meet under its shadow. We cannot ignore it, any more than we can ignore a time-bomb ticking away at our feet. Even as we deliberate here on the problem of peace, some of the great powers arm and gird for war.


We have no power to impose peace. But we do have the moral authority to demand it. I am sure that I speak not only for my own nation but for the people of every other country as well when I say that we do not want war, that we consider it to be neither necessary nor inevitable, and that we believe the powers directly concerned can avert it if they will to do so.


We need no new formula for peace. We have one in our own Charter, in which we pledge; 

to live together in peace to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security: and to ensure, by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest.


We have not only the formula but the rules and the procedures to make it work. It is the resolution, the will to implement it, that is lacking.


The Philippine delegation calls upon the great powers to make a fresh and determined effort not only to resolve their present quarrels without recourse to arms but to find some means whereby they could live in peace long enough to give mankind a chance to build, through the United Nations, stronger safeguards for the security and well-being of all. We make this plea for their sake as much as for ours. War will solve nothing; it can only destroy everything we value. Such is the destructive power of modern weapons that to lose the peace now is to risk losing all.


We, the small nations, for our part can help to avert war by pooling our strength and wielding our collective influence as a third force dedicated to the cause of peace. Less involved than the great powers in the snares of the grim struggle for the political and economic mastery of the world, we, the small nations, are in a better position to represent the true will and the real interests of mankind. We call upon them to close ranks and present a solid front against any attempt to undermine the peace.


The past three years have witnessed the growth, within the United Nations, of a healthy tendency on the part of the small countries to act in conformity with these objectives. The time has come, I believe, for them to assert themselves more completely, to oppose any scheme or manoeuvre which would serve the interests of any single state or group of states at the expense of others, to act for the common good whenever the occasion demands or the opportunity should arise.


The conscience of the world deserves a stronger voice than has spoken for it during the past three years. Let the small nations, speaking in unison, be that voice. The mute millions, the common people of the world, expendable in war, forgotten in peace, cry out for a true and steadfast champion. Let the small nations, acting in concert, be the advocate of their cause and the guardian of their welfare.


The great powers, their hands tied by the inexorable demands of power politics, have been unable to make the peace. The sum total of their achievements is a political stalemate, a precarious balance between the possibility of peace and the prospect of war. It may be that the small nations using wisely their moral power, pitting all the weight of their combined influence against war, may yet tip the balance on the side of peace."	1948-09-23
Carlos P. Romulo	UNGA 5	"I shall take only ten minutes of the Assembly's precious time.  


At the beginning of this crucial session, it is essential that we keep certain important facts in mind.  


The first is that the United Nations, for the first time in its history, has decided to use armed force to put down aggression. The application of military sanctions in Korea is in itself an act of the greatest significance. Even more significant, however, is the manifest desire of a growing number of Member States to give the practice regularity and permanence. The wish is not unreasonable, since it springs from a clear recognition of necessity, nor is it impracticable, since the framework already exists, and all that is required is to give life to a hitherto dormant portion of the Charter.  


My Government welcomes the concrete proposals to this end which the United States Government, through the Secretary of State, has placed before the Assembly. We are prepared to support these proposals on the general principle that the United Nations is greater than any of its organs, and that the United Nations cannot permit the failure of any of its organs to destroy its own existence or threaten the peace of the world. The Organization's sovereign right of survival becomes doubly paramount when it coincides with the duty to safeguard humanity's right to live.  


Under the Charter, the greater Powers, acting in and through the Security Council, have primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. The dead weight of the veto has hampered the effective discharge of this responsibility. The decision on Korea was an outstanding exception, made possible only because there was none to cast the veto. We should not expect this fortunate accident to be repeated, nor leave to luck or chance the possibility of our acting together to combat any future breaches of the peace or acts of aggression. The time has come when the other Member States must endeavour to keep the door for such collective action open at all times through the instrumentality of a stronger General Assembly.  


The Philippine Government, for its part, has given concrete proof of its support of the principle of collective security by sending troops to help the United Nations forces in Korea. Those troops have actually landed in Korea and may now be in action. And, by the way, the latest news reports are to the effect that the blue and white flag of the United Nations is now flying in the heart of Seoul, the capital city of South Korea. By an act of the Philippine Congress, the troops sent to Korea were organized, equipped, and dispatched, to use the language of the enactment, for service in the enforcement of United Nations sanctions and policies, thereby making the Philippines one of the first Member States to make part of its armed forces available for duty with the international police force envisaged by the Charter.  


Our duty is so to develop the residual powers of the General Assembly in matters involving international peace and security that this accidental yet most hopeful beginning towards collective security may be carried to a speedy and successful conclusion.  


The second fact which we should bear in mind is that the accomplishment of this vitally important duty need not preclude the possibility of agreement by negotiation. I reject the careless thinking behind the unhappily popular notion that peace by negotiation is tantamount to appeasement. We are fighting for the peace and security of the world, and I cannot agree that we should let peace and peaceable intentions become the monopoly, even only apparently, of the States that continually and most vociferously profess them.  


If these States have any proposals for peace, we should examine them carefully. If the proposals are dishonest, we shall have enough sense, I am sure, to see them for what they are and reject them as we have rejected them in the past. If, on the other hand, there should be even the slightest evidence of sincerity and good faith in such proposals, then we must leave the door open, lest it be said that we betrayed peace through blindness and the hardness of our hearts. This we can and must do without letting down our guard or allowing ourselves to fall into any wicked snares and deceptions. The assurance of our own strength is excellent capital to negotiate with while we can or to fight with when we must.  


There should be no question of accepting peace on terms dictated by the other side or by any party, for that matter. That would be surrender, not negotiation. We can and will negotiate only on the basis of the terms that were dictated and agreed upon in San Francisco.  


The third fact is that, in the present state of the world, moral power must be supplemented by adequate military power to maintain a rule of law among nations. In the case of Korea, there was never any doubt as to where the moral authority of the General Assembly lay and still lies. Though that moral authority has now been backed by military force and is, for the moment, overshadowed by it, we should ever remind ourselves that in the equation of force and principle, moral power is and must remain paramount. We must remember that we are fighting in Korea not merely to compel respect for the authority of the United Nations or to restore any particular political regime in Korea. We are fighting in Korea for a way of lifethe way of truth, of freedom, and of human dignityand we want the peoples of Asia, Africa, and elsewhere to know that this is the road which we are preparing for them. We must, therefore, look beyond the military victory and formulate even now a programme that will ensure not only the independence but the rehabilitation and unification of the Korean people under a government of their own free choice.  


This leads us to the fourth fact, which is that the case of Korea is in a sense only a symptom of deeper, more elemental problems affecting the stability and security of all Asia. In many of its aspects, the Korean crisis is the end-product of conditions that are well-nigh universal throughout Asia. Those conditions have long been identified with colonial imperialism in the minds of the Asian peoples, and the reminder that a new and more hateful imperialism now threatens to overrun the region will impress them but little unless we show them that it is not the power to dominate and exploit them that we seek to maintain but rather the opportunity to help them to improve their lot and achieve their freedom. Military victory will give us this opportunity, but only genuine understanding will enable us to exploit it. We must give proof of that sympathy and understanding right now.


Beyond the battle for Korea lies the far more crucial battle for the faith of the Asian peoples. Though not as spectacUlar, this latter battle must be waged with equal resolve and without delay. It is therefore highly important that we should seek and continue all necessary measures to raise the standards of living and to advance the political, economic and social well-being of the peoples of the under-developed countries and the Non-Self-Governing Territories. It is equally important that the principle of seeking counsel With the peoples of Asia on matters that concern them, which was proclaimed by the recent Baguio conference of South-East Asian countries, should be accepted as established policy and meticulously observed in practice.


Asia is emerging as one of the principal proving grounds of the United Nations. Korea has already put to the test the determination of the United Nations to maintain the rule of law in international relations, by means of military sanctions if necessary. Greater still is the challenge posed by Asia's poverty and the remaining chains of Asia's bondage. The United Nations will gain in strength and prestige to the extent that it can help to achieve in Asia and in other underprivileged regions of the world the noble purposes proclaimed in the Charterto reaffirm faith . . . in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, and . . . to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom"". In the final reckoning, the United Nations will stand or fall by its successes or its failures in the places that are in direst need of

its assistance and protection."	1950-09-25
Carlos P. Romulo	UNGA 6	"Every session of the General Assembly since H146 has been described as a crucial one. This perhaps proves nothing except that the United Nations. Since its birth has been moving precariously from crisis to crisis.


Today the superlatives are exhausted. They have all but lost meaning and the capacity to impress. Far more impressive than any qualifying adjective is the evidence we have heard from this rostrum of a dangerous freezing of attitudes towards peace. Infinitely more eloquent than any speeches are the atomic explosions echoing from the Siberian waste lands and from the deserts of Nevada.


The one salient feature of this debate has been the curious fact that everybody is for peace. The task of this Assembly would doubtless be easier if there were two clear-cut sides to this debate, one favouring peace and the other favouring war. But everybody is decidedly against sin. Yet it is this unanimous yearning for peace that must give us comfort in these parlous days. Without giving everybody equal credit for speaking sincerely, there is a certain consolation to be derived from the fact that nobody has so far come forward to proclaim the necessity and inevitability of 'var. We have, at least, been spared the brazen glorification of war by the dictators who are now happily dead and gone.


There was a time when war could be a seminal factor of progress, and when it was a fairly good gamble promising dividends to the victor. But there is no longer any percentage in a future atomic war. It has therefore been suggested that, since men cannot be expected to abjure war of their own free will, they may now, in this atomic age, be persuaded to do so by the compulsion of fear. Unfortunately, some of the speeches we have heard here have given us no cause to think so.


Yet the instinct of survival must remain strong even in the human species which seems to be hell-bent for suicide. It is not, I am sure, the unseemly derision with which some have greeted here a serious proposal for peace that bespeaks the deepest instincts of the human race, but rather the simple wisdom of the humble people of all lands who value the great boon of life above all things. This, in the end, must decide the great issue of war or peace, not the grim ironic humour which delights in ridicule and seems determined to win a debating point even at the cost of universal catastrophe.

Three of the great Powers, the United States, the United Kingdom and France, have formally submitted a proposal [Aj1943] for proceeding with the regulation, limitation and balanced reduction of all armed forces and all armaments, including atomic weapons. It is an essential condition of this programme that there be a system of disclosure and verification of all armaments, in successive stages; and concurrently, an effective system of international inspection to verify the adequacy and accuracy of this information. 


The distinguished representative of the Soviet Union has poured unmitigated scorn on this proposal. He has impatiently brushed aside a proposal that, to every honest mind, is fertile with possibilities for calm and orderly consideration. But his sarcasm cannot conceal the fact that this new tripartite proposal represents a substantial advance from a position previously held by the United States of America. For the first time, we have the possibility of an actual census of atomic weapons, along with other weapons, organically linked to the objective of regulating and limiting armed forces and armaments of all kinds, including the control of atomic energy and the prohibition of atomic weapons. Mr. Vyshinsky admits that a method of inventory is appropriate for counting candles, boots and other household goods, thereby implying that it is wholly unsuitable for the ultimate purpose of regulating armaments, controlling atomic energy, and prohibiting atomic weapons. Strangely enough, Mr. Vyshinsky himself provided the best refutation of his own argument, for in the same breath he then proceeded to read out impressive statistics about industrial progress in the Soviet Union. Yet it is certainly not more important for our peace of mind to know how compared with other States, than to know how many atomic bombs and jet planes each of them has and must forgo for the sake of peace. It would appear that Mr. Vyhinsky has no real objection to counting things, except the things that really count.


Since all the Powers must simultaneously agree to a common system of inventory, verification, and. inspection, it is difficult to understand why one Power alone should object to such a proposal. The dangers of disclosure, if there be any, will be suffered equally by all of them. Indeed, the situation will be that the one Power which now objects to the system will receive, in exchange for the information regarding its armed forces and armaments, analogous and comparable information regarding three Powers which it regards as its potential enemies. It is difficult to imagine a more advantageous deal than this. Therefore, unless and until a foolproof system of verification and inspection is first established and in actual operation, the United States of America. cannot be expected to reveal, and we should, in fact, ask it not to reveal, any information which might endanger the security of the world.


Underlying this whole controversy, of course, is the absence of good faith. One regrets to have to say that the USSR proposals exhibit this vice to an extreme degree. We recall, all of us who have attended the previous sessions of the General Assembly, the original proposal of the Soviet Union for a reduction of all armed forces by one-third, at a time when the whole world knew that all the great Powers, excepting the Soviet Union alone, had disbanded their troops. We also recall the well-known USSR proposal for the prohibition of atomic weapons, at a time when it was well known that the United States enjoyed a clear superiority in the production of such weapons which served as a counterpoise to the superiority of the Soviet Union in armed forces.


These proposals formed part of the so-called USSR "" peace, offensive"", a very appropriate term to describe a calculated attempt to win the battle of propaganda with proposals on disarmament which obviously could never be accepted by the other side. All such so-called "" peace offensives"" must therefore be regarded with suspicion. For they proceed from motives which have little or nothing to do with the objective of genuine peace. They are bound to create counter-offensives in kind) and thus reduce the search for peace to a dishonest and even absurd competition for the applause of the gullible.


A certain competitive spirit can be useful in the quest for peace. But the object of the competition oughtt not to be the wmnmg of an argument but rather the diminution of argument through mutual accommodation and conciliation. What the peace-loving peoples of the world would like to see-yes, even the millions who are said to have signed the so-called Stockholm Peace Appeal, is not any ot the great Powers invidiously claiming that it alone is right and all the others wrong but all of them working out together a sane and practical programme for the maintenance of peace. The peoples of the world are less interested in finding out whose claim to peaceful intentions is more eloquently advanced, than in knowing, whether the great Powers are, in fact, ready to translate the repeated peaceful affirmations into deeds.


It is our humble submission that, in order to achieve this end, there ought to be a moratorium on argument merely for the sake of winning a debating point, as well as a moratorium on recrimination, with all the use of invectives merely for the sake of heaping blame on each other. What the world would like to see, I repeat, is all honest a sincere effort to get down to brass tacks: for the representatives of the great Powers to get together and apply themselves to the workmanlike task of securing all mankind from the unimaginable horrors of an atomic war. I have described this task as a workmanlike, as a job akin to masonry and carpentry, in order to show that it cannot possibly be achieved by methods of incantation or legerdemain, nor yet by clever shortcuts no matter how attractive these may seem. it is a process of laying stone on stone and fitting the joints together carefully, one step after another, taking care to smooth out the roughnesses, completing one stage before beginning the next.


The USSR disarmament proposal [A/1944] hardly conforms to this conception of our quest for peace. It depends almost entirely on the assumed magical properties of a prior and simple agreement to prohibit the manufacture and the use of atomic weapons. It glosses over the more laborious details of military inventory, verification, and inspection by an international or supra-national authority which are essential prerequisites for the regulation and limitation of armaments. It ignores the possibility that while all the great Powers may readily adhere to an"" agreement not to use atomic weapons, such an agreement would not in itself create the basic good faith which alone can give peace of mind and security to the world. It ignores the further possibility that even if the great Powers were to agree in good faith not to use atomic weapons for aggressive war, none of them would be likely to forgo its use for purposes of self-defence and retaliation unless there 'were absolute assurance against the clandestine production and stockpiling of atomic weapons. None of them, in short, will ever surrender its capacity for defence unless all the others surrender equally and simultaneously their power to attack.


It is precisely at this point where the proposal of the Soviet Umon is weak, that the new tripartite proposal exhibits many features of strength. The tripartite proposal advances a flexible plan that can be studied, blueprinted, modified and worked out, stage by stage, in step with the growth of mutual understanding and confidence among the nations. Within its framework, the door remains open to the mutual accommodation of views and the conciliation of varying interests. In contrast, the proposal of the Soviet Union is based on fixed and inflexible premises. It starts from an assumption of mutual good faith and confidence which do not exist, and builds the whole structure of peace on the hope that all the Powers, including the Soviet Union, will keep their pledged word without verification or check up. This is to build on quicksand. A sense of realism compels us to suggest that the method of working gradually towards mutual confidence is to be preferred for the purpose of erecting a sound and durable structure of world peace.


This method is bound to be tedious and difficult, but the SovIet Union, which has accomplished prodigies of achievement in war and peace, ought not to be deterred by the prospect of laborious effort. This is a challenge to the Soviet Union, not to abandon its legitimate interests, but to co-operate in working out a common programme of peace that will be for the enduring benefit of all the world's peoples. For here is merely a set of suggestions in the elaboration and execution of which the Soviet Union will have the opportunity to express its views and make its own suggestions in a manner befitting its place and power in the world. But the first essential is a willingness to be reasonable and a desire for conciliation. This means that the one great danger that must be avoided at this stage is the freezing of attitudes towards peace.


In the meantime, and while the rest of the world waits for one clear sign of such willingness and desire on the part of the Soviet Union--and none has come so far from this rostrum--we are compelled to pursue the only alternative that remains in order to maintain international peace and security. This alternative is being pursued in two ways: through the development on paper as well as in the field of a United Nations collective security system, and through the establishment of mutual defence agreements in various regions of the world.


Seventeen months ago, the United Nations decided to repel communist aggression in Korea in the first collective military action ever undertaken by an international organization, Totally improvised and developed from scratch, the United Nations effort in Korea has today become a magnificent field demonstration of the potentialities of a system of collective security, Full credit must be given by all impartial men to the United States which has borne the brunt of the struggle, For our part, we in the Philippines are proud to have contributed our modest share to this historic undertaking. For what has sustained our men and the men of fifteen other nations in Korea has been the determination that aggression shall not go unrepelled and that potential aggressors shall draw the appropriate lesson from the action of the United Nations.


As a result of the communist aggression in Korea, the General Assembly decided at the last session [resolution 377 (V)] to proceed with the study and elaboration of measurespolitical, economic and militarywhich the United Nations may take in case of future threats to the peace, breaches of the peace, and acts of aggression. The Collective Measures Committee has now presented its report to the General Assembly. That report is, in effect, a monumental project on collective security, the first of its kind in the history of international organization. It is our hope that it will be considered with the care and imagination it fully deserves.


At the same time, progress has been made in the establishment and strengthening of mutual defence arrangements in accordance with principles sanctioned by the Charter. The purely defensive character of all these arrangements, including the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance and the North Atlantic Treaty, is patent, and nobody can read into them any aggressive designs whatever, unless it be those who see reflected in them, as in a mirror, their own hidden purpose of aggression. In particular, the series of new mutual defence treaties in the Pacific area and the project of a Pacific security pact, which owes its origin to the vision of the President of the Philippines, have been directly inspired by the fear of communist aggression. The measure of this fear is the fact that the Filipino people have had to swallow the bitter pill of an unsatisfactory peace treaty with Japan in order to permit the integration of Japan into a system of mutual defence against communism in the western Pacific.


As the whole world knows, the leadership assumed by the United States in effecting these arrangements has been virtually forced upon it by circumstances, and accepted by it with considerable reluctance. Mr. Vyshinsky himself, on this rostrum, has pointed out the terrific burden which the American people are shouldering by reason of the vast commitments assumed by the United States to support the economy and strengthen the defences of friendly nations. No one should imagine that they enjoy the sacrifices which these commitments will entail for a long time to come. It has been claimed on behalf of the Soviet Union that its resources are being used to raise the living standards of the Soviet peoples. Yet the vast uninterrupted armaments programme of the Soviet Union must inevitably slow down the elevation of the peoples livelihood. How can anyone conceive that the American people, who have long been accustomed to the highest living standards in the world, would readily accept a diminution of those standards by reason of the rearmament programme unless they understand it to be absolutely necessary? The sacrifice is obviously unequal, for what the Soviet people have never had they will not miss, while the American people will miss what they have always had. Here again, the American people have no choice. They must give of their substance to other peoples in order that the latter may be saved from the misery, chaos and anarchy on which communism feeds. They must rebuild their abandoned defences and help other countries build up their own in order to redress the dangerous imbalance of power which, since the end of the war, has so greatly favoured the Soviet Union.


It is a favourite argument of the pacifists that an armaments race must inevitably lead to war. But the argument is really valid only in reverse. We can have assurance of enduring peace only if all the Powers agree simultaneously to give up their power to attack. In the present state of power politics, the surest way to provoke war is to maintain a condition of imbalance in military powerin short, a condition of unilateral disarmament which places one side at the mercy of the other.


The peace resulting from the establishment of these regional mutual defence arrangements and the consequent maintenance of a certain balance in military power will be at best a precarious peace. It is not the peace we want; it is not the peace we must continue to seek. It is an expedient that harks back to the makeshift remedies of classical diplomacy in the past and, hence, is inadequate to the needs of our present world. Our world in this atomic age requires guarantees of peace far more solid than those afforded by the conventional system of balance of power.


When Mr. Vyshinsky denounces these treaties of mutual defence, he should at least remember that they could almost immediately be rendered unnecessary at a single stroke by the Soviet Union itself. Here, indeed, is where a single peaceful act on the part of Moscow would work like magic in dissipating the fears and suspicions that have settled on mens minds like an incubus. Let the Kremlin but give such proof to the world, and this awful weight would be lifted from the nations and this mad race towards disaster halted at once. We have heard Mr. Vyshinsky several times in a few days from this rostrum. It is very sad to admit that no sign has so far come from him, that the word that heals has not been spoken. All that we have seen so far is a white dove of peace with which he was photographed just before the meeting this afternoon. All men who love peace must continue to hope that the dove will be more than a conventional symbol, and that men will not turn away from this session of the General Assembly in bitter despair and with a gnawing emptiness in their hearts.


In 1948, during the third session of the General Assembly in Paris, the Mexican delegation, under the distinguished leadership of our President, presented a resolution which, in our records, now bears the name of his illustrious country. That resolution [290 (III)], which called upon the great Powers to settle their differences by peaceful means in accordance with the Charter, was unanimously approved by the General Assembly.


In 1949, during the laying of the cornerstone of the United Nations in New York over which it was my privilege to preside [237th meeting], I was so deeply impressed by the historic import of the Mexican peace resolution that I expressed the wish that it ought to have been included among the documents which were placed in the cornerstone along with the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.


Today we have the opportunity, under the guidance and leadership of our President, here in the United Nations, to work out the grave problems of our time in the spirit of the Mexican peace resolution which he himself sponsored in 1948. This is a significant coincidence which, I sincerely hope, augurs well for the effective use of the United Nations as a centre for harmonizing the views and actions of Member States, and for composing their differences within the framework of the Charter."	1951-11-16
Joaquin Miguel Elizalde	UNGA 8	"I wish to extend to Mrs. Pandit the congratulations of the Philippine delegation on her election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. A difficult task lies ahead of her and she has our best wishes for a most successful term.


On behalf of the Philippine delegation, I should also like to congratulate the new Secretary-General, Mr. Dag Hammarskjold, and wish him every success in his important work.


Over the years tradition has sanctioned the use of this general debate as an opportunity for delegations to discuss international affairs and the foreign policies of their governments. During the past several days we have heard various spokesmen debate. The fateful issues confronting the world today.


We of the smaller nations in Southeast Asia must share the universal concern for peace. The reason is simple. In the past we have suffered grievously from war, and we would suffer even worse from the scourge of another conflict. But because we do not dispose of the physical power which in the end determines the outcome of war and peace we venture to speak only softly in the presence of those who do.


This is one of the realities of the world as we know it. Nevertheless, the smaller nations need not apologize for their ambitions, their hopes and their aspirations, for when the problems of the world are viewed in the light of their own radiant outlook, it is clear that they too have as vital a stake as a:ny in the maintenance of peace.


Therefore, if we speak softly here it is not because our peoples are any less deeply devoted to peace. It is rather because we cannot speak with the relative force of countless divisions, air armadas and atom bombs. We have behind us only the moral force which inspires the peoples of all lands to work for a life of opportunity, and to live and to fulfil their destiny in freedom and human dignity.


We speak here for governments. That is our official duty. But we must speak also for peoples. That is our moral obligation. In the degree that we speak for both with equal honesty we shall help to bring this great assembly of nations closer to the high purposes for which it was established.


When a citizen of the Philippines looks at the world around him, this is what he sees: humanity divided, in the midst of political and ideological conflict, faced with the threat of war and, in some cases, even engaged in actual war. Close to his shores he sees, first of all, the war in Korea, recently concluded by an armistice which up to now has by no means settled the major issues involved. But he knows that his country participated in that war and lost a number of its gallant sons, and that the families of the dead and wounded still grieve over their loss. He is also aware that his Government has spent substantial amounts from its limited budget and that today, even after the armistice, it is still bearing its share of responsibility.


He sees a war in Indo-China, carried on by communist elements with foreign assistance, growing in scope and again endangering the prospects of peace in his part of the world. Right next door he sees Formosa, the last stronghold and hope of democratic China. Finally, at home, he is witness to a successful struggle being waged against communist infiltration, subversion and armed attack by indoctrinated groups of dissident elements, a struggle which in one way or another can be compared to the problems confronting many nations in the world today.


This is what he sees in the Philippines and also in the outside world. That we should note with special interest the things that are happening in our part of the world is understandable. This is not necessarily a provincial attitude for, as we shall presently show, conditions in Southeast Asia represent the elements of the larger crisis that afflicts the world as a whole.


The crisis in Southeast Asia is, as in all other cases, a multiple one. Politically, it presents to a larger or lesser extent problems of nationalism and imperialism. Economically, it presents problems in the struggle to overcome the after-effects of retarded economic development and the lack of industrialization, modern equipment and methods, fuller employment, better working conditions, and higher wages. Spiritually, it involves within the countries themselves social adjustment, the attainment of equal tights and political freedom, and the uplift of an increasing portion of the population which has heretofore suffered under conditions of misery and low standards of living.


In short, the countries of Southeast Asia, which have developed rapidly along political, economic and social lines since the Second World War, are at this point endeavouring, despite a natural apathy engendered by the old system, to enable themselves to progress as rapidly as possible abreast of others. These are their aspirations in the material and spiritual fields.


The complexities of power politics cannot conceal the justice of these aspirations. Southeast Asia comprises many lands rich in natural resources, and territories of great strategic importance, and peoples offering tremendous markets and reservoirs of man-power. This fact may be a significant consideration in the thinking and planning of the more powerful.


But the cardinal fact about Southeast Asia and its peoples is that, having achieved  independence and in some cases semi-independence through endless struggle and suffering, they are now making strenuous efforts towards social improvement, political stability, international recognition and greater participation in the solution of world problems, especially those affecting the area. Efforts are also being directed towards greater co-operation in all aspects of human life, increased trade, closer cultural understanding and co-ordination of defenses.


Because the region is so vast, comprising more than haH of the population of the world, and material progress has been slow and often beyond the reach of its peoples, all matters pertaining to Southeast Asia have the character of extreme urgency requiring the immediate attention of the world.


Southeast Asia is often represented as a power vacuum. But it must be evident to all that it is a vacuum waiting to be filled only with a measure of security, economic development, and social justice. For this reason, Southeast Asia is an area of grave peril as well as of great opportunity.


How serious the situation can be we are witnessing today. The old colonial system is passing away; a ruthless imperialism is struggling to encroach in the area. This is timed to coincide with the new political status of the peoples of the region. The powerful motive force of nationalism is being harnessed in many cases to the ulterior purposes of communist imperialism.


The pattern is clear enough. The natural and inherent desire of the peoples of the region to keep and strengthen their political freedom and economic security is being subverted in order to achieve what, to all intents and purposes, is bound to be a hateful form of despotism, and this process may be observed in varying degrees throughout the countries and territories of the region. As a result, in the last few years some of these countries have been subjected to conditions of instability and war. Fortunately the process is well understood and the pattern of development is evident to all. Because we understand the scheme well, it becomes clear that we, as well as the other countries of the free world and the United Nations, should be alert.


For deliberate acts of aggression, the countries of the free world and the United Nations have given and can again give the necessary and appropriate answer. This was given in Korea for the first time in history although, unfortunately, relatively few of the Members of the United Nations answered the call to repel the overt act of aggression. Nevertheless, it is now, universally admitted that this action was a decided step forward in the operation of the system of collective security envisaged in the Charter of the United Nations. As a result of the United Nations' action in Korea it is less likely that nations may henceforth commit acts of aggression with impunity.


The ultimate answer to the communist menace, however, must be considered in terms other than those of direct military assistance. The solution must be worked out on the basis of a long-term generous programme of social, technical and economic assistance, to provide for the uplift and prompt rehabilitation of some of the peoples who are now plagued by low standards of living and economic underdevelopment. Also, a more sympathetic understanding of their history, culture and tradition is of the essence.


We in the Philippines have shared many of the benefits arising from our half-century of relationship with the United States. Our people have become imbued with the principles of democracy and of equality of rights and opportunity. Our association finally resulted in the grant by the United States of complete independence, in goodwill and good faith without any background of violence or serious misunderstanding. This strengthened the faith of the Philippine people in the democratic way by which other major problems can also be solved.


What we are trying to do is to set forth the problems of the south-east Asian countries in the light of the world situation as it now exists. This is important when we take into consideration the large populations involved whose participation can be decisive in regard to the prospects of peace.


The United Nations has been described as a revolution. It has also been called a substitute for revolution. It is, in fact, a place where the historical process, which has hitherto been left to chance, may be given direction and a measure of order. Here can be brought disputes and threats to peace which formerly would most likely have been decided by force. Here we have a planned programme for the development of peoples towards self-government and independence. Here a more positive attempt than heretofore is made to create a life of greater abundance and larger freedom for all peoples by methods of international co-operation.


In all the things that the United Nations does or tries to do today Asia provides a good testing ground.


We in the Philippines profoundly believe in the purposes and principles of the United Nations. We shall continue to give our share of support to the observance of these purposes and principles. We still maintain that the area of gravest menace is today to be found in Southeast Asia. We must stress the point that the greatest efforts towards world peace must be exerted in this area.


For this reason we see the necessity of a policy of close co-operation and friendly understanding among the peoples of Asia. We shall continue to be gravely concerned with the problem of peace in Korea and Indo-China. It will be our purpose to participate to the limits of our resources in all efforts to resist the fast-growing acts of infiltration and subversion in our part of the world. We shall humbly endeavour to help promote better understanding in political, economic and cultural matters among the peoples of the region. We shall continue to support the efforts of the United Nations and the specialized agencies along these lines, We shall not falter in our support of programmes of technical assistance and in the concerted effort to increase productivity and to rationalize trade.


Southeast Asia is an area of great trial for the United Nations. That trial is only beginning and the end is still far off. The outcome will determine whether political freedom, security and economic well-being will become a reality in the lives of all the peoples of Southeast Asia.


The world is confronted with innumerable problems of a varied nature which have been accumulating since the end of the Second World War. For their solution the countries of the world must exercise patience and fortitude. They must, furthermore, be imbued with a sincere desire to work together. In this manner the high objectives of peace may be finally attained."	1953-09-28
Carlos P. Romulo	UNGA9(a)	"In his now historic address to the General Assembly on 8 December 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower prefaced his proposal for an international pool of atomic energy for peaceful purposes with a heart-warming tribute to the United Nations. He said:

""At the same time that I appreciate the distinction of addressing you, I have a sense of exhilaration as I look upon this Assembly. Never before in history has so much hope for so many people been gathered together in a single organization. Your deliberations and decisions during these sombre years have already realized part of those hopes. But the great tests and the great accomplishments still lie ahead. And in the confident expectation of those accomplishments, I would use the office which, for the time being, I hold, to assure you that the Government of the United States will remain steadfast in its support of this body. This we shall do in the conviction that you will provide a great share of the wisdom, of the courage and of the faith which can bring to this world lasting peace for all nations, and happiness and well-being for all men.""

President Eisenhower said that a year ago. To make this speech, he flew to New York directly from Bermuda where he had been in conference with Prime Minister Churchill of the United Kingdom and the then Prime Minister of France, Mr. Laniel, about the grave issues of war and peace. The event thus possessed all the elements of high drama. First, the Bermuda Conference was held within the framework of the old classical diplomacy wherein the heads of the three great Powers of the Western world met together in secret in an attempt to maintain peace by strengthening the free-world coalition against a potential enemy. Secondly, President Eisenhower, as head of the most powerful nation in the world, spoke on a matter truly of life and death for all humanity. And thirdly, the General Assembly of the United Nations was deliberately chosen as the platform from which the historic message would be given to the world.

What President Eisenhower told the General Assembly has been heard around the world. His bold proposal on atomic energy has become the number one item of world statesmanship. Four days ago, before this Assembly, the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Dulles, proposed an agenda item which will enable the United States to report on its efforts to explore and develop the vast possibilities for the peaceful uses of atomic energy.

In connexion with this new agenda item, which I consider to be the most important matter before us at this ninth session of the General Assembly, the Philippine delegation notes with gratification that the Soviet Union has offered to reopen the suspended negotiations on President Eisenhower's atoms-for-peace plan. But I warn that in these negotiations we should not get caught in any hidden booby-traps, and we must beware of diplomatic ""stalling"". Let us go ahead and not stop, look and listen every time we hear a siren song from the other side of the Iron Curtain. Reserving our right to discuss this question in more detail when it is taken up in committee, I simply would like at this juncture to express the hope that Secretary Dulles' proposal embracing four steps(a) an international agency for peaceful development of atomic energy; (b) a scientific conference under the auspices of the United Nations; (c) a reactor training school; and (d) participation of foreign experts in cancer work in United States hospitalsis a world plan, not a national plan, and that there is no idea here of bypassing the United Nations. We must bolster the waning prestige of our World Organization by making the proposed international agency a United Nations instrument from the very beginning.

But to convince the world that the United States means to carry it out, we should deal less with generalities and more with specific details. In other words, the United States must be ready to tell the General Assembly, among other things, how much nuclear material it is ready to contribute and what funds it is willing to allot to finance the international pool.

A fellow human being, an innocent Asian fisherman, died a few days ago as a result of atom tests, and the world welcomes America's determination ""to change the emphasis on the atom from war to peace."" But that event of December 1953, when President Eisenhower for the first time presented his plan of a world pool for peaceful development of atomic energy, is significant for another reason: it dramatically points up the degree to which the United Nations has been sadly left behind in the furious pace of scientific progress in the modern world. It was appropriate that President Eisenhower should have chosen to submit his fateful proposal on atomic energy to the United Nations. But the United Nations lacks the authority to act promptly and effectively on the Eisenhower proposal. Suddenly we realize that no political instrument exists today which could cope with so great a need. Somewhat sadly, we realize that the United Nations has become a vessel too frail to be the repository of humanity's hopes and fears in the atomic age.

Nine years ago I had the honour to represent the Philippines during the San Francisco Conference which gave birth to the United Nations. As the representative of a country that had suffered grievous loss of life and destruction of property during the war, I gave earnest support to every proposal which was intended to enable the United Nations to cope with the menace of future war. After two months of strenuous effort the Conference completed the Charter of the United Nations, the first words of which proclaim the determination of the peoples of the United Nations ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind.""

The Charter of the United Nations was completed on 26 June 1945. Twenty days later, on 16 July, the United States set off the world's first atomic explosion. In another twenty days, on 6 August, more than one month after the signing of the Charter, the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. In retrospect, these dates are significant. The final blueprint of the United Nations was completed shortly before the world was aware that atomic power had become a reality. The eloquent words with which the Charter opens, affirming mankind's determination ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,"" therefore referred to the only kind of warfare which men had known until then. It was murderous and destructive warfare which made no distinction between combatants and non-combatants, but it was nevertheless warfare which was waged with conventional weapons of finite potency. It was total war, and it was right that those who founded the United Nations in San Francisco should have established as the primordial aim of the Organization the prevention of similar wars in the future.

Meanwhile, the world has moved from the menace of total war with conventional weapons towards the menace of absolute war with bacterial, atomic, and hydrogen weapons. The United Nations probably has the means to intervene effectively and in time to prevent or halt a war fought with conventional weapons. But it has not the means to do so in the case of war fought with absolute weapons. The reason is simple: the United Nations was not built to the scale of the atomic age in which we now live. Another way of putting this idea is to say that, in the short space of nine years, the Charter of the United Nations has become dangerously obsolete to the degree that under its existing provisions the Organization is powerless to act effectively to forestall universal catastrophe.

The most convincing proof of this statement is the confirmed impotence of the Security Council. This is the organ, as we all know, which has primary responsibility for maintaining or restoring international peace and security. I shall not take away from this organ the credit which rightly belongs to it for settling or helping to settle disputes between nations and for preventing or stopping a number of threats to the peace, breaches of the peace, and acts of aggression. But in the only instance among these, namely the communist aggression in Korea, which involved large-scale fighting and which had the actual potentiality of leading to a third world war, the Security Council was saved from total impotence only by the narrowest of accidentsthat is, by the providential absence of the Soviet Union from the meeting which ordained military sanctions against the communist aggressors. Moreover, Korea happened to be a theatre of war which the Soviet Union did not consider to be important enough to require its actual participation and all-out effort.

Under the Charter, the Security Council is responsible for organizing readily available armed forces from Member States for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security. In the past eight years nothing concrete has come out of its efforts in this field. It was left to the General Assembly, under the ""Uniting for Peace"" resolution to formulate plans in advance for the organization of collective measures against future acts of aggression.

Furthermore, the Security Council is primarily responsible for formulating plans for the establishment of a system for the regulation of armaments. The records dealing with this matter form the most dreary chapters in the history of the United Nations. In eight years of study and discussion nothing has been accomplished. The armaments race has proceeded without interruption and at a faster pace than at any other peacetime period in the history of the world. Today, having wasted eight years in a fruitless search for an acceptable formula for the regulation of armaments including atomic weapons, we have the sinister spectacle, to use the words of President Eisenhower, of two atomic colossi, the United States and the Soviet Union, malevolently eyeing each other across a trembling world.

The great weakness of the Security Council, of course, is that while it has all the attributes of authority, it lacks the actual instruments of power necessary to make that authority real. There is another weakness of the Security Council to which I wish to draw the attention of the Assembly. It is the anomaly that Asia is not represented among the non-permanent members of the Security Council and it is an injustice to the people of Asia who have achieved independence since the drafting of our Charter.


Article 23 of the Charter provides that the Security Council shall consist of eleven members, five of whom are permanentand the time has come to eliminate permanent members also from the Security Council. This Article then states:
""The General Assembly shall elect six other Members of the United Nations to be non-permanent members of the Security Council, due regard being specially paid, in the first instance to the contribution of Members of the United Nations to the maintenance of international peace and security and to the other purposes of the Organization, and also to equitable geographic distribution.""

In San Francisco, the great Powers arrived at an understanding according to which Latin America was awarded two non-permanent seats and Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and the British Commonwealth, one seat each. No place was reserved for Asia. Indeed Asia at that time, in the eyes of the representatives in San Francisco, did not exist as a separate geopolitical entity.

Times have changed and a new Asia has risen, but this misunderstanding remains unchanged. Today we, the peoples of Asia, are disenfranchised in the Security Council and only those of us who belong to another so-called geographic unit, namely the British Commonwealth, can be elected to the Security Council. Neither Indonesia, nor Burma, nor Thailand, nor my own country have the right to be represented in this organ of the United Nations which, according to the Charter, has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace.

Important groups of citizens in Asia, veterans who have helped to create the United Nations and those who have fought under our blue flag in Korea, have called upon the United Nations to revise the understanding or misunderstanding of San Francisco. This call of Asian veterans has been endorsed by 18 million ex-servicemen representing twenty-five countries, including my own, united in the World Veterans Federation. In associating myself with my former comrades-in-arms, I feel that I do not only speak in the name of the people of the Philippines but also in the name of all peoples of Asia. We want the United Nations to give us our rightful place in so important a body as the Security Council.

It is significant that President Eisenhower chose to speak before the General Assembly. This body, in which all the sixty Member States are represented, has been variously called an international debating society, the forum of humanity, and the town meeting of the world. It is weak where the Security Council is strong, at least on paper. It has none of the outward attributes of authority, but it has power over the hearts and minds of men out of all proportion to the actual authority it wields. Far from being a Parliament of Man, it has authority only to make recommendations without being able to venture upon coercive sanctions.

I have said of the United Nations in general that it has become a vessel too frail to serve as the repository of the hopes and fears of humanity in the atomic age. Lacking something better, we have, at least in the General Assembly, a repository of the good sense and good conscience of humanity.

It used to be said that while the United Nations has not achieved much success in the political and security fieldand disarmament is one of its more awesome failuresit has done much useful work in the economic, social, cultural, humanitarian, trusteeship and legal fields. During the past seven years, this has been largely true. Despite the cold war, the United Nations has accomplished tasks of international cooperation which, against the background of previous history, are nothing short of prodigious. The problems of world economic and social development, particularly the effort to raise standards of living, the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms, the march of the Trust and Non-Self-Governing Territories towards eventual freedom, the continued development of international lawall these have been faced and measurable progress has been made in their solution, in the very shadow of the cold war. We have the programme of technical assistance and we have the useful work continually being done by the specialized agencies in the fields of agriculture, industry, science, education, health, finance, trade, transportation, etc.

All this is true. But today, there seems to be a general feeling that the possibilities of United Nations action even in these non-political spheres have become pretty nearly exhausted. We have come to a point of diminishing returns. There is growing reluctance on the part of the developed countries to assist the underdeveloped countries in their programmes of economic development. An example is what has happened to Point Four; another, the freezing of the Expanded Program of Technical Assistance; and yet another the virtual pigeon-holing of the project for the establishment of the special United Nations fund for economic development.

In another field, there is growing resistance of the more advanced countries to any other action designed to promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the world. The reasons they give are strange indeed: they either say that they do not wish to risk lowering their own standards by signing conventions or covenants concerning these matters with the less developed countries, or they sayas they do on questions like those of Tunisia, Morocco, and of the race conflict in South Africathat the United Nations is forbidden by the domestic-jurisdiction clause of the Charter from interfering in these matters. In the field of trusteeship and Non-Self-Governing Territories we have come to a point where we are not only at a standstill, but where the Trusteeship System and the principles underlying Chapter XI of the Charter are ""withering on the vine"".

It is difficult to escape the feeling that on all sides there is a concerted and deliberate campaign to arrest progress in these non-political fields under the auspices of the United Nations.

One generous way of explaining this is to say that since so much progress has been achieved in these fields during the past seven years, we ought prudently to settle down and consolidate the gains that have been made. I am afraid, however, that the real reason is two-fold: first, that further progress in these fields must now await the conclusion of the Cold War and the establishment of genuine international co-operation among the great Powers; and, secondly, that the United Nations has exhausted the limits of its possibilities of action under the Charter as it exists.

We are back to where we started. We realize that there is something naive and unreal in trying to promote higher standards of living, human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law in a world where men are condemned to live in constant fear of universal death. We are compelled to admit that under the present Charter the United Nations is incapable of performing the service that it should perform for the peoples of the world in this atomic age; and it is the most important and urgent single element of that service to save humanity from the menace of atomic destruction.

President Eisenhower, in his speech already referred to, justly credited the United Nations with realizing part of those hopes which had been pinned on it by the peoples of the world. But, in his own words, that the great share of the wisdom, of the courage and of the faith which can bring to this world lasting peace for all nations, [470th meeting, para. 81] is yet to be provided. In other words, the question remains whether the good sense and good conscience of humanity will be asserted effectively and in time to forestall a war of annihilation with atomic and hydrogen weapons. Since our margin of safety is so narrow, we must ask ourselves whether we should be content with the United Nations as it is, knowing that it was tailored to the needs and uses of a pre-atomic age, and whether we should accept the terrible risk which attends the widening gap between our onrushing atomic science and the inertia of our political know-how.

The answer is not easy. For, throughout history, men have sought to retain the forms and institutions of their daily life long after these have been outmoded by the ideas and precepts of advancing science. In the past, however, there was always a sufficient margin of safety which afforded men enough time to adjust themselves to the new conditions. Except for sudden revolutionary short-cuts often necessitated by a massive accumulation of intolerable evils, it has nearly always been possible to remodel the old forms and institutions for the more spacious requirements of the new ideas and principles.

The question, I repeat, is whether in this atomic age we are permitted the time to do this. It is a serious question, but one which should not lead to panicky solutions.

We must reject, to start with, the notion that the United Nations should be scrapped. I think that, faced with the possibility of universal disaster, sensible people everywhere are inclined to feel somewhat more comfortable and secure with the United Nations than without it. If it gave us nothing more than this sense of added comfort and security, the United Nations would be worth having.

However, a sense of security is not enough. The danger which mankind faces is both real and immediate, and it must be met simultaneously on two levels. First, we must endeavour to make the United Nations function to the utmost of its possibilities under the Charter, using its undoubted moral influence to help prevent impending disaster. Secondly, we must boldly explore ways of so strengthening the United Nations that it may have, before it is too late, the power to prevent universal catastrophe.

In other words, it is not enough to say that the United Nations is better than nothing. We shall find before long that the United Nations is not good enough unless it is the best that human ingenuity can fashion, unless it is able to provide that great share of the wisdom, of the courage and of the faith which can bring to this world lasting peace for all nations. To cope with the atomic revolution, we need a political revolution of at least equal imagination and magnitude.

In accordance with Article 109 of the United Nations Charter the tenth regular session of the General Assembly, which will be held next year, will discuss a proposal to call a conference to review the Charter. If such a conference is heldand let us all hope that it will be heldit is, however, generally doubted whether any major amendments to the Charter will be approved. Since amendments are subject to the veto of the permanent members of the Security Council, it is naturally assumed that amendments purporting to strengthen the United Nations at the expense of the great-Power veto and of the principle of the sovereignty of states will have little, if any, chance of adoption.

Nevertheless, necessity is still the mother of invention. Our need is for peace, no longer as a mere convenience but as the indispensable condition of human survival. This thought will not sink in easily, for mens minds have been inured to situations of measurable and surmountable danger. But the irrevocable finality of the danger we face will inevitably moderate the prevailing pessimism and compel all Member States, especially the great Powers, to be more receptive to proposals for the revision of the Charter of the United Nations, no matter how radical they may seem.

In considering amendments, the yardstick should not be what seems to be possible in the context of the present international situation, but rather what is necessary to enable mankind to avoid atomic destruction. Accordingly, any and all proposals should merit careful consideration which would make it possible for the United Nations to cope with this imminent danger. Such proposals would certainly include: the restriction of the scope of domestic jurisdiction and of the concept of the sovereignty of states, the limitation or abolition of the veto, the establishment of a system of weighted representation of Member States, the abolition of permanent seats in the Security Council, and the placing in the hands of the United Nations of the means to enforce decisions involving international peace and security, particularly as regards the regulation of armaments, control of atomic energy and prohibition of atomic weapons.

There are those who will say, this is world government and dismiss such proposals as utopian and impractical. But in the present context of human affairs, any revision of the United Nations Charter will be less than practical unless it attempts wisely and courageously to bridge the gap between what is possible and what is necessary. This can be done only by a bold new approach, a desperate frontal assault, if you will, upon the problem of international organization, undeterred by the limitations of past or present experience. Do we discount the inertia which induces the human mind to seek the line of least resistance and to devise partial or makeshift remedies for recognized evils? By no means. However, while the force of custom is indeed powerful, it is not more so than the instinct of survival. Therefore, in this matter, we must not only think in terms of the improbable but also attempt the seemingly impossible. For the alternative is to let the world drift willy-nilly towards disaster, borne on the ancient tides of power politics and war.

I am aware that there are those who would choose this dread alternative. Their attitude has taken the form of an aggressive attack against the United Nations, not because it needs to be improved and strengthened, but because they would destroy it utterly and let every nation withdraw into the hard shell of its sovereignty like a turtle. The reference to the turtle is a deliberate one. It emphasizes the fact that it is impossible, in this age of the jet plane, to return to the age of turtles. Mr. President, Gentlemen: it is much later than we think."	1954-09-27
Felixberto Serrano	UNGA 9(b)	"When, in the afternoon of 30 September 1954 [484th meeting], the representative of the Soviet Union, Mr. Vyshinsky, appeared before the General Assembly, he must have noticed that almost all representatives from the sixty member States of the United Nations were in attendance. The advance notice that he was to speak that day had bestirred the Assembly into unusual activity. What, may I ask, must have been the cause of this unusual interest and anxiety over what he had to say? A war-weary world, still bleeding from the wounds of the last global conflict and fearful of the fast-gathering clouds that hang over the surface of the earth, focused its rapt attention on the Soviet representative, hoping against hope that, against the background of so much political cynicism in the past, some words might drop from his lips which might blaze the way to the peace of mankind.


As he glided from one point to another, however, it became increasingly evident that he was following the old mould and the usual pattern of Soviet propaganda. Beyond his proposal for the solution of the problem of atomic and hydrogen weaponsthe nature, extent and motive of which yet remain to be seenhe radiated no ray of hope, cut no new pathway to peace, and suggested no new method of approach or even a revised formula for solution of those problems upon which there have been long-standing deadlocks. On the other hand, he emitted fire and gall against the United Nations for its unwillingness to sanction a wrong and for its refusal to recognize the fruits of unlawful acts; he deplored its failure to meet effectively the problems of international peace and security attributable mainly to Russia's own intransigence; and he denounced collective systems of self-defence dictated purely by the supreme requirement of self-preservation and brought about under the compulsion of relentless acts of subversion and aggressive incursions of predatory neighbours. The representative of the Soviet Union holds nothing but contempt for the efforts of the United Nations to maintain world peace and security. By its repeated failures, said the Soviet representative, the United Nations has been prejudicing its international authority.


I do not propose to make here a detailed review of the achievements of this world Organization in the domain of peace, human freedom and social progress, to all of which the Soviet Union is a witness and rarely, if ever, a participant or contributor. Through direct action, mediation, or the exertion of its moral influence, the United Nations avoided unlawful interference in the internal affairs of Iran in 1946; it eliminated what was called ""the annoying presence"" of British and French troops in Lebanon and Syria in the same year; it protected Greece from further Communist incursions in 1947; it brought armistice to Palestine and independence to Indonesia; it averted the spectacle of bloodshed in Kashmir; and it halted the forces of aggression in Korea. We owe it to the constitutional elasticity of the Charter, supplemented by wise statesmanship, that the United Nations was able to overcome its organic weakness, and through the ""Uniting for Peace"" resolution [377 (V)], it succeeded in utilizing and applying its collective forces to halt aggression in Korea.


In addition, this Organization adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is certainly consoling that in this atomic age, while man, in his evil genius, has sought to unleash those cosmic forces which threaten him with total extinction, he yet labourswhile he livesto clothe life with honour and dignity and surround it with conditions and circumstances essential to its fulfilment. Lastly, the United Nations has brought the promise of a more abundant life to millions of benighted people who have long languished in darkness and poverty before the birth of the international trusteeship system. He must be a confirmed cynic indeed who cannot find satisfaction in these substantial achievements of the United Nations during its brief existence of nine years.

The United Nations certainly has not lived up to all our hopes and expectations. But it is a human institution and, like all human institutions, it must proceed by a process of trial and error. On the other hand, if the United Nations had failed where it should have succeededif it was unable to deal effectively with breaches of the peace or threats to international securityit must be borne in mind that the behaviour of the Soviet Union in some of its principal organs lies at the root of such failures. It is, indeed, most painful that condemnation of the failings of the United Nations should have proceeded from a source mostly, if not wholly, responsible for them.


When the founding fathers of the United Nations devised the system of permanent membership with the right of veto for the five Powers in the Security Council, it was in the happy anticipation that these big Powers would act with unanimity in meeting every problem of breach of the peace or threat to international security. None ever suspected that the Soviet Unionwhich shared with the other four big Powers both the burdens and the glory of a common victory in the last World Warwould, in the task of building thereafter the peace of the world, block almost every effort of its former allies in the solution of the security problems of mankind. The record of the Security Council discloses that, to proposed solutions to many a vital problem of peace, the Soviet Union has invariably applied its veto power. Indeed, it has used the veto no less than sixty times, thereby reducing that organ, which was entrusted with the primary responsibility of maintaining international peace and security, to almost complete paralysis.


Mr. Vyshinsky, speaking for his Government, decried the formation by the free countries of the world of regional arrangements for self-defence such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the South-East Asia Collective Defence Treaty, signed in the capital of my country last month. Deliberately ignoring their expressed objective of self-defence, he denounced these regional arrangements as instrumentalities of aggression and, therefore, calculated to augment rather than diminish the existing world tension. I do not propose to speak on behalf of the European Defence Community more than to say that in the common danger that faces the free countries of Europe and the United States, these nations realized that in the pooling of their military and economic resources alone could they find reasonable assurance of security for their freedom, political independence and territorial integrity. My Government is immediately concerned only with the new multilateral defence pact of which it is a signatory.


My country is weak, but it is not blind to the danger to its national existence; it is small, but not resigned to its present impotence. For a number of years it was racked by Communist subversion, which broke into open defiance of the constituted Government in 1946. The effective use of military force alone, strengthened by a humane and courageous leadership, brought it under control. On the other hand, my country saw Communist China fast rising to its full panoply of power in the mainland of Asia and exerting its gravitational force on the surrounding regions. It saw and was astounded by the unexpected Communist aggression in South Korea and had in fact contributed its own limited resources and a part of the flower of its youth to the collective forces of the United Nations to suppress such aggression. It heard the disquieting plea by Thailand for a probing team to ascertain Communist incursions along its borders. It saw the grim sign in Indo-China and the danger signs, no less grim, in the other regions of South-East Asia. Even now, it watches with dread the ominous clouds that hang over its tiny island-neighbour of Quemoy, wondering what time or destiny holds for it in the few hundred miles of water that lie between.


Still bleeding from Communist rebellion within, and sensing that it lies directly in the pathway of a relentless Communist expansion, my country has no other recourse than to seek union with countries similarly threatened. Weak and defenceless by itself, it must seek its salvation by forging ties of common defence with those whose freedom is menaced by a like peril. This is the justification of my Government for its participation in the South-East Asia defence pact recently concluded in my country, which has been the subject of vitriolic attacks by the Soviet Union representative and other representatives at the Assembly. Self-preservation is still the supreme law for nations as it is for individuals.

Objection has been voiced here by the representative of India to a statement in the Manila Treaty with respect to the treaty area extending beyond the actual boundaries of the participants in the treaty, upon the ground that, by fixing such a treaty area, the members of the Manila Pact have in effect indirectly attempted to trespass on the territory of other States, and that, as a matter of fact, it goes beyond the clear implications of legitimate collective self-defence provided for in Article 51 of the Charter.

I cannot see any validity in this contention. The representative of India should know that, if the eight participants in the Manila Pact saw fit to fix a treaty area beyond the actual boundaries of its members, the only purpose was to provide a measure of the degree of imminence of the danger of any external acts of aggression which may be committed, so far as the actual members are concerned; and, whenever it has been determined by the members of the treaty that there is an external act of aggression against any area beyond, but clearly near, the actual boundaries of any of its members, they shall then be justified in engaging in mutual consultations with each other for the purposes of legitimate collective self-defence. That was and could have been the only intention of the eight signatories of the Manila Pact.

But collective self-defence was not the sole concern of my Government. No less overriding was our solicitude for the right of peoples to determine their own destiny. We believe that humanity cannot remain half slave and half free, and that all governments must rest on the consent of the governed. To the credit of the eight signatories of the Manila Pact, they solemnly declared:

""... in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, they uphold the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and ... they will earnestly strive by every peaceful means to promote self-government and to secure the independence of all countries whose peoples desire it and are able to undertake its responsibilities.""

It is my view that, if the principle of self-determination had not been upheld by the participating States to the Manila Pact, my Government would seriously have hesitated to give it the seal of its approval. It is for this reason that we consider the Pacific Charter, not only as a companion piece, but also as an integral part, of the defence agreement.

It may be asked: How can a country reasonably complain when, by its dangerous activities, it has compelled other countries to seek safety in the consolidation of their resources for common defence?


It has been said that the plan for the so-called defence of South-East Asia is built on the notion of enlisting some Asian countries in a scheme to carry out armed intervention, and that it was aimed at hiding the special interests of the colonizers who wish to dominate that area. The Soviet Union representative said [484th meeting, para. 90]: ""It is ... a perfidious scheme to set one group of Asian peoples against another."" 

The accusation is none too complimentary to the South-East Asian signatories of the Treaty. It considers them willing pawns of the Western Powers in the promotion of their alleged colonial interests. The historic struggle for freedom of these Asian countries, and the firm stand they have always taken against the continuance of colonialism on any relevant issue before the United Nations, are adequate guarantees that they will not be privy to any scheme of colonial advancement by any Western Power. On the other hand, the accusation flies in the face of the contemporaneous history of the Western participants to the defence agreement. My Government knows of no colonial interest which the United States has to promote in Asia. On the contrary, after a successful experiment in democracy in my country, which theretofore had no parallel in history, the United States voluntarily withdrew its sovereignty. The United Kingdom has similarly granted independence to India, Pakistan, Burma, and Ceylon. By virtue of the Indo-China truce, France has agreed to the holding of elections throughout Viet-Nam, Cambodia and Laos to permit their peoples to set up a government of their choice which would be, of course, a faithful expression of their right to self-determination. If any signatory has other remaining colonial possessions in South-East Asia, it is the hope of my Government and the other signatories to the treaty that, in pursuance of the solemn declarations of the Pacific Charter, it will take such progressive steps as are necessary for the eventual emancipation of those subject areas.

True, some South-East Asian countries have not for the present seen fit to join the defence agreement. It is the hope of my Government that, in God's appointed time, they will. They cherish identical freedoms with us. They recognize the existence of a common danger to those freedoms. Our differences lie only in the appraisal of the imminence of such danger and in the manner of combating it. We trust, however, that these differences will narrow with time, and it is in this confidence that the Manila Pact has left the door open to our other Asian neighbours.


Our attention has once again been called to the necessity for peaceful coexistence between the Soviet Union and the free countries of the world. We are again told that only by recognizing the reality and importance of peaceful coexistence among States of diverse social structures and political ideologies can we expect to normalize international relations and establish the peace of the world on an enduring basis.


On the face of it, the plea for peaceful coexistence made by the Soviet Union and the allied Communist countries is by no means unacceptable to the free world. The essence of democracy is freedom, which necessarily implies tolerance of opposing systems or of antagonistic political or economic thoughts. I am quite certain that there is no desire on the part of the democracies to impose their political or economic concepts and ways of life upon any unwilling people.


The unfolding pattern of international communism, however, has disclosed conclusively that peaceful coexistence has been foisted on us as a peace formula, not for the aims that the phrase implies, but as a weapon of subversion and the ultimate domination of the world. More accurately, peaceful coexistence is, to the Communists, a euphemism for cold war or a camouflage for incursions into free areas to undermine their political and economic structures. Fortunately, the Philippines, in common with a large number of the other free countries of the world, is keenly alive to the sinister implications of this deceptive formula for peace, and chooses to rest its security on firmer grounds.


There is, however, one comforting feature in the speech of the Soviet Union representative. I refer to the draft resolution which he proposed [A/2742 and Corr.1], entitled ""Conclusion of an international convention (treaty) on the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic, hydrogen and other weapons of mass destruction"", calling for the establishment of an international control system for the observance of the convention, on the basis of the proposal made on 11 June 1954 by France and the United Kingdom [DC/53, annex 9]. My Government does not propose to express its views on the merits of the draft resolution. All that it hopes to see is the day when weapons of mass destruction shall be completely eliminated from the armaments of States and when the new discoveries of man's genius shall be made available, by common consent, for the advancement of his comfort and happiness. My Government wants to view the draft resolution as a happy indication that the Soviet Union has not utterly shut the door to the solution of an issue upon which hangs the fate of human civilization. We take it to mean that the Soviet Union shares with the free world the dreadful recognition that, with free use of atomic and hydrogen weapons, there is no more survival for the victor than for the vanquished in the total annihilation that will descend upon all.


Let me close with a friendly reminder that, in present as in past Soviet Union proposals, deedsI say ""deeds""not words will be the ultimate test upon which the Soviet Union will be judged by an anxious world."	1954-10-06
Felixberto Serrano	UNGA 11	"My delegation is particularly pleased to join the other delegations in congratulating Prince Wan Waithayakon on his election to the presidency of this body. It is a high honour seldom endowed in so rich a fashion; but he deserves it as richly by his selfless labours in the cause of amity and international co-operation. Enhanced by his winsome ways, his enviable experience and familiarity with the problems which regularly confront the General Assembly, hold out every happy augury for a fruitful and rewarding session.


Withal, my Government views his election with every feeling of friendly elation. Our two countries have had the closest connexions, not only because of our alliance in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization but also because we share in large measure the problems of nation-building peculiar to our region of the world.


We open our deliberations this yearthe eleventh in the life of the United Nationsunder the shadow of menacing events. In the past three weeks, developments of fearsome portent have cast the issue of peace in very grave doubt. In the Middle East, war reared its ugly head again; and in Central Europe a subject people traced once more the ancient pattern of rebellion in the name of human freedom.


The full significance of these developments is not clearly visible to us at the moment. It may be that a new order of things is struggling to be born; or it may be that the brief but bright era of good feeling which followed the summit meetings at Geneva has trailed away and humanity is back again among the travails of spirit which marked the painful years after the Second World War. Which one it shall be depends on the energy, the wisdom and the strength of purpose of the leaders of nations. But for all of us, undoubtedly, the occasion presents an opportunity for the purification of conscience. Unfortunate as recent events have been, they have a positive and redeeming side. The speed and firmness with which the General Assembly acted to meet these situations is one cause for rejoicing. As on similar occasions in the past, this body has conclusively proved that it could bring to bear the full weight of its moral force whenever the peace and security of the world are endangered.


Assuredly, none of the problems connected with the recent Middle East hostilities and the Hungarian situation has been solved, except possibly the immediatebut, I should say, considerableissue of halting the continued destruction of human life. But it is a condition which necessarily precedes the larger solutions. It now remains for the Assembly, in its collective wisdom, to turn the grievous loss into a positive gain, to feel its healing way to every wound and woe, to use the tragic events as points of transition to a permanent and enduring peace. We realize, even as we speak these words, the scope and difficulty of the task which faces us in our efforts to achieve this great aim. Fortunately, this Assembly is lacking neither in patience nor in determinationpatience and determination born of the profound yearning of mankind to overcome its afflictions.


We therefore venture the hope that, with respect to the Middle East question, whatever might be the ultimate fate of the issue of the management of the Suez Canal, the principle of free and continuous passage through the waterway shall be ensured. On the Egyptian-Israel dispute, we look forward to an immediate restoration of peace in the area, and, in a more favourable climate, energetic steps should be taken to reach a final and conclusive settlement of the obstinate causes of friction.

The urgent and pressing interest with which my Government regards the Hungarian situation has been demonstrated by its token contribution towards the relief of Hungarians made destitute by the recent clashes in Budapest and elsewhere. We express the ardent hope that the energy and the formidable pressure of the collective moral force of this body will cause the Soviet Union to desist from any further attempts to stifle the legitimate aspirations of the Hungarian people.

Last year, sixteen new nations were admitted into the fold of the United Nations, and three more nations were welcomed just over a week ago. A once unmitigated deadlock which had lasted for years has thus been broken. In itself, the action of the Assembly in admitting the new Members bespoke the spirit of goodwill and co-operation which marked the relations among nations then. Looking towards a larger purpose, however, it was clearly the intention of this body to move towards the realization of the principle of universality of membership within the permissible ambit of the Charter.

There is every indication that the day is not far off when the Assembly can truly speak of itself as representing the voice of humanity. As it is now, the Assembly has been immeasurably strengthened, and a new confidence has been gained which will serve us well in deliberating over the issues in the present session.

The problem of disarmament has long been an unmanageable one. Following a resolution [914 (X)] of this body last year, the main efforts of the Disarmament Commission were directed at framing proposals of a confidence-building nature. Towards this end, the United States proposed the creation of technical exchange missions and allocation of demonstration test areas in which both President Eisenhower's ""Open Skies"" plan and Marshal Bulganin's ""control posts"" idea would be given a trial.

However, efforts at an approximation of views notwithstanding, the United States, the United Kingdom and France, on the one hand, and the Soviet Union, on the other, could find no common ground nor mutual trust in each other's proposals. Lately, Moscow suggested a non-aggression accord between the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and those of the Warsaw Pact, and aerial reconnaissance within the area of disposition in Europe of their principal forces to a depth of 800 kilometres east and west of the demarcation line. Against the immediate background of an announced fresh nuclear test, and calculatingly timed in the present context of the Middle East crisis, this new Soviet proposal is, however, being viewed by the Western Powers as another distasteful piece of propaganda.

We are thus compelled to admit that no substantial progress has been achieved in settling this vexing question. It has become abundantly clear that, in the face of the continuing deadlock, a less ambitious approach to the problem, timed under propitious circumstances and narrow enough to inspire confidence and a spirit of conciliation, may pave the way to partial achievement. My delegation will accordingly support any proposal calculated to promote such limited agreements in the hope that eventually they will help build a climate conducive to the ultimate settlement of this most intractable of the problems that ever confronted this body.

There is a lesson to be learned in the dispatch with which agreement was reached on the establishment of the International Atomic Energy Agency. On 8 December 1953, President Eisenhower proposed its creation, and, following the successful International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in Geneva, the negotiating Governments completed the draft statute of the Agency, submitting it in September 1956 to the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy of Member States of the United Nations and specialized agencies. In the following month, the Statute was unanimously approved and, after ratification by the Governments of Member States, the Agency is expected to come into being in 1957.

I have briefly traced the consecutive steps in the establishment of the International Atomic Energy Agency by way of emphasizing the kind of prompt and vital response possible among nations when the cause is worthy and the spirit of co-operation is enlisted in the service of humanity. In the creation of an Agency for the peaceful utilization of atomic energy, the Assembly found a cause that transcended ideological and political differences among nations, for it promised a future for all mankind that will be free from poverty and disease and in which The labours of man can coax the fabled abundance of the earth. The manner in which the Agency will marshall its capacity in the immediate years ahead will provide the test of whether our vision of the atom can be translated into terms of actual abundance on a world-wide scale. In the example of the successful constitution of the International Atomic Energy Agency, we may take the needed courage to find our way through the thorny problems which face us year after year.

There is, for instance, the question of Korea. In its sixth annual report [A/3172] the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea (UNCURK) describes the great gains being made by the Republic of Korea in establishing a representative Government and in rehabilitating its economy through the aid of the United Nations.

It is a source of gratification to hear that the once embattled Republic is rapidly progressing towards stability and widening international recognition. It is, however, disquieting to note at the same time that while we had, for the last two years, hoped for, and urged, some progress towards the basic aims of free elections in, and unification of, Korea, not one forward step has been taken to realize them. Indeed, when UNCURK adjourned sine die on 1 January 1956 and virtually relinquished its functions and responsibilities to a mere committee of four nations, it took a step that may induce the South Koreans to a sombre belief that they eventually may be left alone to work out their own salvation. It, too, places in serious doubt our oft-repeated avowal of continuing our quest for an early solution to the Korean problem. We cannot view this situation without grave concern. Granted the complexity of the problem of Korea, it is not one, we believe, which the Assembly can ignore, except at peril to the principles of the United Nations. We cannot abdicate our responsibility in promoting the search for fresh solutions. If we do, then we shall have justified the insistent fears that the division of Korea is, in fact, permanent. We surely cannot permit this tragic result by our sufferance or default.

A problem of equal complexity on this year's agenda is the question of Cyprus. Under different circumstances, it would be pleasant to note that the question is not quite what it was when the Assembly discussed it during the ninth session. Since then the United Kingdom has accepted the principle of self-determination in regard to Cyprus and has agreed to institute limited self-government for the Cypriots. However, the negotiations over the constitution of the proposed Cypriot Assembly broke down, and shortly thereafter Archbishop Makarios was exiled for his alleged complicity with the supposed terrorists on the island. Further negotiations are contemplated by the United Kingdom on the basis of a Cyprus Constitution which is now being drafted. In the meantime, the question is before us on two antagonistic pleas: one by Greece, invoking self-determination for Cyprus, and the other by the United Kingdom, seeking an examination of alleged Greek support for terroristic activities in the island.

Now, as in the past, the quest for solution revolves around efforts at striking a happy reconciliation between the Cypriot claim for freedom and the just recognition of the strategic value of the island in the security set-up in the area. The Philippine delegation desires to reaffirm its full support of the principle of self-determination for Cyprus, but within such time and under such conditions as will fit into the context of the security requirements of the free world. And it is our fervent Hope that such an objective will be attained through the orderly and peaceful processes of negotiation.

In this connexion, we cannot fail to note the great progress towards the exercise of self-determination among dependent peoples. Tunisia, the Sudan and Morocco have just joined the ranks of the United Nations. I am happy to announce that my Government has formally extended diplomatic recognition to these three new Members of the world community. On 6 March 1957, the territory of Ghana, comprising the present Gold Coast and Togoland under British administration, will become a fully independent State within the British Commonwealth. The establishment of this prospective new State became a reality last May when Togoland under British administration voted for incorporation in the Gold Coast in a plebiscite held to determine whether it desired union with the Gold Coast or continuation as a Trust Territory. And in 1960 Somaliland is scheduled to gain independence under the terms of an earlier Assembly resolution.

There have been instances of dependent peoples being guided or prepared for the eventual assumption of independence, but the evolutionary procedures of the United Nations in this respect are certainly without parallel in history. What the world Organization has achieved with spectacular success is to ride the wave of historywhich contemporary nationalism isand transform a usually violent agitation into a constructive and peaceful process.

In the field of human rights, we have advanced with giant strides in the task of spelling out the precious rights of men. We have entered the second phase of our labourthe system of annual reports and studies in specific human rights and the institution of advisory services. My delegation, however, feels we can now commence to explore the possibilities of working out genuine programmes of action by which the rights we have defined and declared may find progressive application in countries where they are not observed.

Finally, we note with gratification the advances over the past year in the work of this Organization in the economic and social fields. The momentum of progress along traditional channels offers every hope of continued acceleration. But fears have been strongly expressed about the persistent failure to halt the widening gap in the rate of development between industrially advanced countries and the under-developed countries. The consequences of such a trend, unless arrested, may prove disastrous to the desirable balance of economy among nations. Here, therefore, is another area of immediate and urgent interest; for the future stability of the world will depend on whether we succeed today in eliminating those causes of tension and unrest which have their roots in economic and social inequalities.

The task that confronts us in this eleventh session is a heavy one, rendered more complex and more difficult by the forbidding international climate. But, in the spirit of mutual understanding and tolerance, there is no obstacle, however formidable, which we cannot overcome. The Philippine delegation is prepared to bear its sustainable share of the common task with the fullest measure of goodwill and co-operation."	1956-11-22
Carlos P. Romulo	UNGA 12	"It is generally agreed that this twelfth session of the General Assembly has been convened in circumstances less tense than have obtained in many a season, and certainly far less so than those which attended the preceding one. We can look back on the two great crises of Egypt and Hungary last year and candidly note that the United Nations, bespeaking the conscience of mankind, succeeded in resolving the first because the voice of that conscience was heeded, but failed to resolve the other because that same voice was scornfully disregarded.


As we begin the work of the present session, it is well to bear in mind two lessons that may be drawn from this experience. The first of these is that the General Assembly has indisputably become the supreme custodian of the principles of peace, justice and freedom in the world. The second is that the moral authority of the General Assembly is bound to gather strength as much from the negative actions of those that wilfully flout that authority as from the exemplary behaviour of those that sincerely respect it.


These developments augur well for the future of the United Nations. We are not among those who look with dismay on the growing ascendancy of the General Assembly. That ascendancy was inevitable from the moment it became clear that the Security Council, immobilized by the cold war and hamstrung by the veto, would default on its high responsibilities under the Charter. The powers of the Security Council, which are defined with precision and with an impressive panoply of form and procedure by the Charter, have not been successfully brought to bear on the grave conflicts that have lately arisen among nations. Inversely, the broad and diffuse powers of the General Assembly have acquired increasing force and definition, partly from the obvious need to fill the vacuum of authority, and partly from the conviction that in a divided world, and so long as the world is divided, we must accept the moral sanctions of the General Assembly as the only available substitute for the unenforceable political and military sanctions of the Security Council.


I believe we are entitled to note with satisfaction that, on the whole, the General Assembly has successfully met the ever-growing challenge to its responsibilities. As one who has participated in the work of the General Assembly since its inception, I would agree to the observation that the deliberations of this body appear to have undergone a certain mellowing. Some may attribute this to the fact that we all have grown somewhat tired of speeches, especially angry and vituperative speeches. But I would go further and say that most of us have become increasingly aware, in recent years, of the gravity of many of the issues that confront the world today, and have been sobered by the prospect of the mortal consequences of our failure. More and more, we are beginning to realize the need to use this body, not as a debating society or as a forum of propaganda, but as an instrument of conciliation, a veritable centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of  common ends. The greatest and most imperative of these ends happens to be the survival of the human race.


In these days of peril for all mankind, who is there so reckless as to risk our common fate on an angry word, a haughty challenge or an implacable threat? Who is there so foolhardy as to gamble away our hope of survival on a witticism or a clever turn of phrase, on the winning of a debating point or the besting of an opponent? There may have been a time when these little triumphs could yield a certain excitement, like heady wine. But that time is no more. The time has come when we must listen carefully, think deeply, speak deliberately, and act with all possible moderation, eschewing the dubious satisfactions of a cunning argument or an effective stroke of propaganda in favour of the lasting benefit that would come to all men from every step, however modest, that is taken towards mutual understanding and the accommodation of conflicting or divergent interests.


The principal task of this Assembly is to help free mankind from the nightmarish fear of war.


The Philippine delegation represents a small country that cherishes its freedom and respects the freedom of others. We covet nothing that belongs to others, and we threaten no one. We entertain no ambitions of power or glory in the world. Our highest hope and our sole object in the international sphere is to unite our efforts with those of friendly countries and the United Nations in order to preserve the liberties and enhance the material and spiritual welfare of our people in circumstances of greater prosperity and larger freedom for all.


It is in this spirit that our delegation approaches the tasks of the General Assembly. It is in this spirit also that we shall try to indicate briefly our views on some of the principal questions before this body.


We all agree that the prevention of a third world war is the principal task of the United Nations, and that disarmament is the necessary condition for the accomplishment of that task. Both the General Assembly and the Security Council have therefore given the highest priority to the question of disarmament and the regulation of armaments. I believe we can all agree that nobody wants to start an atomic war. The three great Powers possessing atomic and nuclear weapons certainly know that it would be sheer madness to do so. Yet, after years of discussion, no agreement on disarmament has been reached. The proposals and counter-proposals submitted to the Sub-Committee of the Disarmament Commission in London and now presented to the Assembly show one thing clearly: the Powers have not been able to agree because mutual confidence is lacking and, specifically, because of the fear of a surprise attack.


It is no discredit to the Powers to say that it is natural for them initially to submit proposals on disarmament which tend, to a lesser or greater degree, to afford themselves a certain advantage. It is in the nature of any negotiations on disarmament that they should do so. But it is precisely the function of such negotiations to reduce their differences and gradually to equalize the sacrifices and obligations as well as the benefits and guarantees accruing to all the Powers concerned.

The Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union told us the other day that the Governments of the Western Powers have the wrong approach to the question of disarmament because they are looking for the kind of disarmament agreement which would be advantageous to themselves and detrimental to the security of others. This is obviously untrue because, while the Western Powers would certainly prefer such a one-sided agreement if they could get it, they know better than to expect the alert negotiators of the Soviet Union to be thus so easily taken in. What is true, as I said a moment ago, is that both sides are bound  indeed, they are expected  to advance initial proposals that afford them a certain advantage over the other. It will be recalled that the Soviet Government itself once proposed the withdrawal of Soviet and American troops to a distance of 500 miles east and west, respectively, of the Rhine, a proposal which would push American troops beyond the Atlantic coast, while the Red Army would retire to outposts within easy marching distance of Western Europe. The Soviet Government has also indicated that it would accept an agreement for inspection of Soviet Siberia in exchange for a reciprocal right covering United States territory west of the Mississippi. Now, such proposals are obviously advantageous to the Soviet Union and detrimental to the security of others. Yet they were not scornfully dismissed for that reason, but on the contrary formed the basis of counter-proposals by the Western Powers. However inequitable such proposals may appear, they serve a useful purpose in indicating acceptance of the need for military disengagement and mutual inspection as essential elements of an over-all agreement on disarmament.

The Soviet Government continues to advocate an agreement to renounce forthwith the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons in advance of an adequate control system over fissionable material and in advance of an agreement on the reduction of armed forces and supervision of stocks of armaments. But the position of the free world on this question has been made clear and it rests on a candid appreciation of the actual situation. The free world must rely on these terrible weapons as its only defense against the Red Army, which, combined with the armies of the Warsaw Treaty countries and of Communist China, the free countries can never hope to equal. Soviet statesmen are well noted for their realism and they must surely understand that an agreement to outlaw atomic and hydrogen weapons would be of no value whatever in a situation where the free world would be compelled to use these weapons in order to repel an invasion by vastly superior enemy forces, even if such forces are armed only with conventional weapons. It should therefore be utterly clear to them that the free world would agree to relinquish these weapons only if such agreement were accompanied by an agreement to ensure, by means of an adequate control system, that fissionable material would never again be produced for weapons purposes, and by an agreement to reduce armed forces and to place existing stocks of armaments under international supervision.

From these considerations it is clear that the military posture of the free world is a purely defensive one. The existing military alliances like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the South-East Asia Treaty (SEATO), and the Baghdad Pact are no more than manifestations of that defensive posture. Surely, no Soviet statesman really believes that these alliances would initiate an attack against a Power like the Soviet Union which possesses atomic and hydrogen weapons and now boasts that it has developed the means to deliver them to any point on the globe. Nor is it anything but ludicrous to suggest, for example, that tiny Luxembourg and little Denmark, along with Iraq and Iran, are plotting to attack the Soviet Union or that Thailand and the Philippines are planning to invade Communist China. All these weak and small countries have formed alliances with the Western Powers because they have been and continue to be menaced by Communist military power as well as by the subversive policies of international communism. I know that the Communist States are trying to allay our fears by assuring us that they are dedicated to the principles of peaceful coexistence and of respect for the political independence and territorial integrity of other States. But, only a few years ago, the Philippines nearly succumbed to communist subversion and rebellion, and hundreds of Philippine lives were sacrificed in the struggle. In our vicinity, we have seen what happened in Korea and Viet-Nam. Only the other day, the representative of the Federation of Malaya spoke to us from this rostrum, in a moving speech, of the sufferings and sacrifices endured by his people in their long struggle against the forces of militant communism. Is it suggested that all these are mere hallucinations and that we should heed the siren call of peaceful coexistence by renouncing the protection which the defensive alliances afford us?

It is no secret to the Soviet Government that these alliances have imposed onerous military and financial burdens upon all the Member countriesespecially upon the United Statesof which their peoples are eager to be relieved. Nor is it a secret to the Soviet Government that these alliances, together with the military bases agreements that implement them, have become a source of no little irritation between the peoples and Governments of the countries belonging to these defensive arrangements. No country likes to have foreign troops indefinitely stationed in its territory, and this is true of all foreign troops, whether Soviet or American. But in the case of my country, as in that of all countries where foreign bases are located, we are under the imperious necessity of suffering the inconveniences and irritations as well as the risks of having such bases in our territory in exchange for security against the incomparably greater danger of communist subversion and attack.


Peaceful coexistence and the relaxation of tension are certainly desirable goals towards which we should bend our common efforts. But it is not enough to repeat these phrases day after day and year after year, as if those conditions would materialize by the sheer power of verbal incantation. The honest and reasonable thing to do is to accept the state of mutual distrust which exists between the great Powers as one of the harsh and bitter realities of our time, and to move forward doggedly, step by step, away from there.


Here, it seems to me, is the real difference between the Soviet and the Western approaches to the question of disarmament. The Soviet proposals appear to start from the premise that sufficient mutual confidence already exists between the great Powers to enable them to agree forthwith to prohibit the use of atomic and nuclear weapons. The Western proposals, on the other hand, start from the premise that progress towards disarmament and the regulation of armaments must be made step by step, each step to be taken as mutual confidence develops following the successful implementation of the preceding one.


Despite this divergence of approach there is evidence in the discussions of the Sub-Committee of the Disarmament Commission in London of the willingness of both sides continually to narrow down the differences between their actual proposals. Any move to adjourn the conversations indefinitely cannot possibly be in the interest of anyone.


In all fairness it can truly be said of both sides that they have made concessions to each others point of view in the course of their prolonged negotiations. It would be a grave disservice to mankind and to the United Nations to call off the conversations at a time when the possibility of agreement is brighter than it has been in many years. The General Assembly should therefore express its earnest desire to see the disarmament talks resumed at the earliest possible moment and urge the Powers concerned to re-examine the proposals with a view to further narrowing down their differences until an agreement -- even a limited initial agreement on a limited number of points -- is reached.


A hardly less crucial problem of our time is the need to liquidate by peaceful means and as speedily as possible the remnants of colonialism in various parts of the world. In the twelve years since the United Nations was founded, this process of liquidation has progressed at a pace which no one could have anticipated. There are those who deplore this development as unwise or dangerous, representing a reversion to a species of nationalism leading to political and territorial fragmentation which has been outmoded by the powerful drifts towards international or even supranational modes of co-operation in the twentieth century. Those who advance this objection seem to forget that Europe itself provides historic proof of the fact that nationalism is a necessary weapon in the liberation of peoples from oppressive domination of one kind or another. If nationalism was necessary to ensure the freedom of the European peoples, it can hardly be less so in the case of the peoples that have come under their dominion.


But whether wise or dangerous, the speedy release of peoples from colonial rule is one of the stubborn facts of our time. History may well record this phenomenon as the principal distinguishing mark of the political biography of the twentieth century. You cannot wish this fact away, and you ignore it only at your peril.


It is unfortunately true that international communism has all too often subverted national freedom movements and taken them over for its own ends. But where this has happened, the colonial Powers have not been without blame. By condemning the native peoples to a life of ignorance and poverty, and by forcing them to take up arms in order to win their freedom, the colonial Powers have virtually opened the front gate to let the Communists in even before they themselves have had time to make a hurried exit through the back door. The disastrous consequences of a policy of refusing to recognize a people's right to self-government and independence, or of a policy of too little and too late, are evident in the contrasting experiences of Viet-Nam and Malaya, as well as of Indonesia and the Philippines. Where the United Kingdom and the United States gained friends and allies, the other Powers not only lost their territories anyway but also missed the chance of retaining the loyal friendship of their peoples. Moreover, the experience of the Federation of Malaya and Viet-Nam conclusively proves that colonial peoples seeking their freedom will defend that freedom against communist interlopers, provided they are not driven to the extremity of accepting communist aid in order to throw off the colonial yoke.

There is still time to revise the policy of non-recognition of the right to self-government and independence or the policy of ""too little and too late. The problem of Algeria is certainly one which imperiously demands such revision.

International communism is often condemned as the principal instigator of national freedom movements. The Communists are guilty, of course, but rather less so than Powers like the United Kingdom and the United States which, by liberating their colonies, have shown other subject peoples that colonialism is no longer in fashion and that there is a way of liquidating it without bloodshed and without an aftermath of hate. Each day which marks the peaceful grant of freedom to a colony is certain to make harder still the job of keeping the others in continued subjection.

Nor will the example of the United Kingdom and the United States be lost to the peoples that have fallen under the yoke of communist imperialism. They are bound to realize that whereas the classical Western imperialism is on the way out in Asia and Africa, they now find themselves under a new form of imperialist domination more potent and oppressive than any that the world has ever seen. Among them also, the same spirit of nationalism, which the Communists have fanned in other places for their own ends, will remain alive and grow in strength until it explodes in their own faces.


This is not an idle prediction. In the souls of the peoples that have lost their freedom and independence and succumbed to communist domination, the pride of national identity and the will to freedom are not dead. Of them it can truly be said that their heads are bloody but unbowed. Soon or late, they will rise again to claim the freedom and dignity they have lost. We know that whatever happens, the Soviet empire will never again be the same after the ruthless crushing of the Hungarian revolution.


The twin scourges of war and imperialism remain the two outstanding questions on our agenda. The General Assembly has no task more important than to help encompass their speedy elimination. The Philippine delegation, I assure you, will join in the earnest effort to accomplish that task."	1957-09-27
Felixberto Serrano	UNGA13	"Mr. President, it is both my privilege and my pleasure to congratulate you, on behalf of my delegation, on your election to the presidency of this Assembly. I would say that this is a signal honour which you richly deserve, if for no other reason than your long and useful association with this body. We have every reason to hope for, and to look forward to, a most successful session of the Assembly under your leadership.


Two profoundly encouraging signs have of late been widely noted in this Assembly: namely, the remarkable self-possession which has been exhibited in the midst of tempestuous discord, and the increasing tendency to approximate unanimity in the decisions taken. The first affords a sure indication of the growth and emerging maturity of the Assembly; the second augurs well for the weight and force of its influence wherever its presence has been invoked. It is heartening that this inclination to comprehensive accord could manifest itself even in those central issues of our time on which one would expect a bitter divergence of views. May the General Assembly at this thirteenth session, stimulated by past example, voice its universal sentiments in the same universal fashion.


This development, however gratifying, should not mark from our view the realities which today so harshly divide our world and fragment mans allegiances. In a sense, there are no ultimate solutions; there are only ultimate problems. But this is merely to say that we acknowledge the frailties of manthat we are not gods. We cannot, however, be relieved from the inescapable obligation to persist in seeking solutions to the problems with which the life of mankind is sorely beset. 


Of these problems, none confronts us so starkly as the issue of whether man, in his lack of wisdom, shall cause his own extinctionor whether man, in the fullness of his wisdom, can achieve his own redemption. The resolving of this issue permits, I dare say, no compromise with time. For until we resolve it, the race of man on Earth must remain a haunted and tormented one.


Disarmament has been a perennial problem with us. Undismayed by the lack of results, we have tried to carry on as patiently as we could. But the past year, I must confess, was a disappointment. The inability of the Disarmament Commission to meet was a severe setback to the disarmament negotiations. The refusal of a principal Power to participate in the discussions constituted a distinct disservice to the cause of peace.


It may be true that the procedures and techniques of the Disarmament Commission have not been altogether perfect. But such imperfection is hardly ground for a course of action which, if obstinately pursued, would have reduced the Commission to ultimate impotence.

Disarmament, in the view of my delegation, is not one of those questions which can be negotiated on the principle of ""the more, the merrier."" Four recent developments, however, add considerably to our hopes that a ""breakthrough"" might be developing in the interminably protracted discussions: first, the apparent understanding among the principal Powers to suspend, on a provisional basis, further experimental explosions of nuclear weapons; second, the Geneva accord on the feasibility of policing a ban on nuclear test explosions; third, the report of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation concerning the hazards of radioactivity resulting from such explosions; and fourth, the projected meeting in Geneva of technical experts from the signatories of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and of the Warsaw Pact on the problem of preventing a surprise attack.

It may be stated that none of these developments has a direct bearing on actual disarmament measures. But if it is accepted that the safest way to test the workability of any disarmament measure is to place it on an empirical basis, and that only such schemes as could be properly controlled at a given time should be adopted, then we submit that any agreement on enforcing the temporary cessation of nuclear tests, which may be reached by the Powers principally concerned, cannot fail to yield the widest implications for the disarmament problem as a whole.

There is one aspect of this matter about which there can be no argument, namely, that the provisional agreement to suspend tests is a positive response to the deeply human emotion of fear aroused by the dangers of radioactive contamination. While the conclusion of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation is not final, and may be considered debatable in some quarters, it does tend to support the growing view that, the less radiation, the better for the human race. It is a view which must certainly be taken into urgent account in the coming negotiations on the halting of nuclear tests. 

From all this, certain instructive conclusions emerge. First, the wisdom of the Assembly in enforcing over the past four years the ""stage-by-stage"" measures approach to disarmament and related questions has been amply vindicated. Secondly, it would appear that technical agreements may hereafter become an essential precondition of disarmament negotiations, providing as they do a basis which may well influence favourably the course of such negotiations.

We must therefore hope that the projected conferences will confirm our high expectations and that their results will enhance, in turn, the prospect for an early accord on the control of outer space and its exclusive use for peaceful scientific purposes.


The success of space satellites, if dedicated to the arts of peace, holds out for mankind a promise of rich and unimaginable rewards. It would be manifestly unfortunate if that hope were again frustrated by our failure to agree on such controls as would ensure the use of outer space solely for peaceful scientific purposes. As early as two or three years ago, proposals to that effect were initiated, but it is now apparent that they have become entangled with considerations of a different sort. It must, however, be abundantly clear that if we procrastinate any longer, hoping merely to stumble on a solution instead of actively working to achieve it, the pace of events will inevitably overtake us and result in irretrievable loss of the opportunity to utilize outer space to man's advantage rather than for his own destruction. It is hoped therefore that any scheme, even of an interim nature, for the peaceful utilization of outer space will not become inextricably involved in the general context of disarmament negotiations and that it will be made a subject of separate agreement.

Twice in the last two years, special emergency sessions have had to be convoked to deal with problems arising out of the troubled situation in the Middle East. We all know the happy results that attended the efforts of the Assembly in the crisis of 1956results which have exceeded even our most sanguine expectations at the time. As for the more recent crisis, we have every reason to hail the decision of the Arab states themselves to shoulder the primary responsibility for the stability and peace of their region. Apart from its special relevance to the immediate problem of the Middle East, the reaffirmation of the principle of non-interference has served as a healing touch to those who have suffered from its violation and as an emphatic warning to those inclined to flout it for selfish ends that they can do so only at their own peril.

It will hardly escape notice, however, that the Middle East problem has three aspects which are so intimately interlocked that a solution on one level, while fully desirable, may not necessarily produce the kind of lasting peace that we all ardently wish for the peoples of the area. In other words, the problem has to be viewed in its widest context.

There are no magicians in the Assembly, but only a group of burdened men trying as best they can, in a spirit of common humanity, to help solve each others difficulties. It may well be that a completely viable solution to the Middle East problem is at this time beyond our grasp. But it may also be that by keeping the broad issues in view, as a whole and in their naked reality, we will be kept from being led too far astray in our quest. We feel that we can sum up the Middle East problems as follows: first, the power rivalries in the region; second, the existing difficulties between the Arab States and Israel, principally as they centre on the question of refugees; and, finally, the growing strength and direction of Arab nationalism. All of these issues have been before the Assembly in one form or another ever since the United Nations began. But to say so merely emphasizes the scope, and the intractable nature of the problem which, before this session is too old, will confront us once again.

Of the specific situation before us, it is appropriate only to repeat, pending the receipt of the Secretary-Generals report, the truism uttered by the preceding President of the Assembly to the effect that deeds, not words, would supply the ultimate test of the wisdom or lack of wisdom of the Assemblys decision. In the meantime, we remain vastly encouraged by the mounting evidence of good faith among the Arab nations in their relations with one another.

In the Western Pacific, some two hundred miles from my country, the world attention has been riveted on the two tiny islands of Quemoy and Matsu. Since 23 August, Communist China has subjected these islands to sustained artillery action of varying intensity with the avowed intent of seizing them and the Nationalist stronghold of Formosa. The United States has in turn repeatedly warned that it will not relinquish its responsibility to defend Formosa, including the related areas of Matsu and Quemoy, if in the judgement of its President the attacks on those areas could be a prelude to an attack on Formosa.

As we watch day by day the varying pressures that are made to bear upon the crisis, we can only express the fear that beyond a certain point it may no longer be possible for the countries concerned to keep control of all the factors of the situation. This dire possibility and the ever-present danger that wide areas may be engulfed if the crisis reaches unmanageable proportions make the question of the off-shore islands a critical case of profound concern to us all.

In consonance with the Charter of the United Nations, my country cannot accept or condone the use of armed force in the settlement of international questions. We recognize no valid substitutes for the peaceful procedures of the Charter.

The talks now being conducted between the United States and Communist Chinese ambassadors in Warsaw have given us some ground for relief. While we may indulge in guarded expectations as to the outcome of such talks, my delegation supports the suggestion already put forward that, as evidence of good faith, Communist China should observe in the interim a de facto cease-fire in the off-shore islands area. This will serve to insulate the Warsaw negotiations from the varying fortunes of opposing military action in the Asian mainland. We hope that Communist China will not insist on conditions so obviously unacceptable as to wreck every fair prospect of reasonable agreement.

If the talks break downand let us hope that they do notand the current situation persists, the Assembly or the Security Council, I assume, will not fail to bring the influence of its collective wisdom to bear upon the issue in such form and manner as are suitable to the circumstances of the situation and in conformity with the principles of the Charter.

Elsewhere, on the periphery of the Middle East, lie the two problem spots of Cyprus and Algeria. In either case, the issue has shifted from the essence of self-determination to the form and process by which it should be applied. In the case of Cyprus, we cannot but deplore the violence which has raged periodically therein. We note, too, with mixed feelings of misgiving and hope the persistent efforts to discover some feasible common ground among the complex rival claims of the three countries involved. In the present circumstances, precipitate efforts to press too far or too fast any conceivable adjustment could wreck the chances of a permanent solution. The danger, as we see it, is not so much that there seems to be no solution in prospect as that, if the breach is so widened between the countries involved, a future solution may be rendered even more difficult.

In the case of Algeria, the situation has, for well-known reasons, clearly deteriorated, or at any rate has not advanced materially towards a solution. It will be recalled that at its last session the Assembly suggested that quadripartite talks be entered into by France, Morocco and Tunisia. Since the unfortunate incident at the Tunisian border, France and Tunisia have entered into certain agreements concerning French troops on Tunisian soil, suggesting the possibility of restoring harmony between the two countries. It may then be possible, the French having achieved their constitutional reform, to look forward to informal discussions with a view to exploring possible solutions to the Algerian problem.

It is clear, however, that both problems have reached the point where they cannot be permitted to deteriorate further. The overriding necessity of reaching an accommodation of the interests of the parties in each case must compel them before long to discover an appropriate solution to their difficulties and create a favourable climate for a just, peaceful and democratic settlement. As we see it, the role of the General Assembly is to encourage the parties in their search for a mutually acceptable formula of conciliation and compromise.

It remains for me to speak of a principal concern of a majority of the Members of our Organization: the economic development of less developed countries. It might be more true to say that this is a principal concern of all the Members, since in the last analysis world stability is directly dependent on the economic health of the whole earth, not just of a few favoured segments of it. The greater the imbalance in economic progress, the more certain the possibility that social tensions and upheavals will occur and pose lasting threats to international peace. Fortunately, the principle of common responsibility and joint action in this respect is now an accepted one.

It is in this light that we must view the approval last year of the establishment of the Special Fund. The aim of the Fund is to increase technical assistance by a substantial margin and ultimately to provide capital for the development of less-developed areas, particularly in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The new programme thus touches on two of the principal problems facing most of the States Members of the United Nations.

There are no quick or certain nostrums for the problems of economic stability, which are patently incapable of being solved in isolation. But those of us who are concerned most of all with the strengthening of the United Nations will do well to keep in mind that in the end the strength of the Organization can have its source only in the strength of its individual Members.

For thirteen years we have carried on patiently and painfully, through crisis after crisis, to bring peace to our troubled world. We know not where our efforts will find surcease: whether in the survival of man with a promise of a richer life or in his total destruction. Wisdom may lose to folly, but let it not be said that, in the lifetime of this Organization, we who gather under its canopy year after year have faltered in our resolve to work out man's salvation."	1958-09-23
Francisco Delgado	UNGA14	"May I be permitted to begin by joining with those who have preceded me in expressing the wish and the hope of my delegation, and mine personally, for the prompt recovery of our President, Mr. Belaunde, so that he may rejoin us and let us have the benefit of his leadership.


Also, may I publicly express our most heartfelt condolences to the Government and the people of Ceylon for the irreparable loss that they have suffered in the untimely death of their late great Prime Minister.


Finally, may I be permitted to publicly reiterate our most sincere sympathy to our friendly good neighbour, Japan, to her Government and her people, for the terrible ravages that the typhoon has caused to their country.


The General Assembly has convened this year in an atmosphere of hope. Not since 1946, when this body held its first session, have there been such happy auguries of peace and understanding among the nations.


The Cold War, which has divided the world for more than a decade, is today being subjected to the warmer winds of conciliation, mutual accommodation and neighbourly living. In the very middle of an armaments race that has created weapons capable of annihilating mankind and destroying this planet, we have suddenly come to realize that the old historic struggles among nations for power, wealth and influence, based on military might, have lost all meaning or relevance.


The message which the artificial satellites and the rockets to the moon have written across the heavens consists of the fateful words: Learn to live in peaceor die.


Love is a better counsellor than fear. But since the love of peace has, in the past, availed little to deter mankind from making war, we may hope that the common fear of universal death will now impel humanity to discover the means of living together in a condition of tolerance, justice and peace.


We must believe that humanity has the necessary will and ability to do this; that man will, in time, be able to hold in check his age-old propensities to selfishness, greed and cruelty, and allow his better instincts to fashion a suitable response to the iron necessity of survival.


The most auspicious event since the advent of the cold war is surely the exchange of visits between Premier Khrushchev and President Eisenhower. When the plan for this exchange was first announced, our President, Carlos P. Garcia, of the Philippines, warmly hailed the news in a public statement in which he expressed the fervent hope that the exchange of visits between the heads of the world's two most powerful states would contribute to the establishment of a just and enduring peace for all mankind.


We are well aware that this kind of peace cannot be made by one single act, however dramatic, nor achieved by wishful thinking through Utopian means. We understand clearly that ideal objectives must be subjected to the test of realistic solutions. The heavy burden of accumulated wrong, the age-old heritage of suspicion and hate, oppression and injustice cannot be suddenly wished away by waving a magic wand. We must work with these unhappy realities of the world as they are, and strive patiently to let mans generous instincts provide an eventual and effective healing.


The task before us is long and hard, but the important thing is to make a beginning. And an honest beginning can only be made if, first of all, we stop adding to what I have already described as mans heavy burden of accumulated wrong and age-old heritage of suspicion and hate, oppression and injustice. This means, in effect, that even while we strive to remedy the evils of the past we must earnestly determine to prevent new evils from arising.


I represent here a small country whose people love freedom and justice as much as they desire peace. For the sake of peace and human survival, they would wish sincerely that the spirit of conciliation, which is moving amongst us, will continue to improve the relations among the great Powers. At the same time, loving freedom and justice as they do, our people equally fervently wish that no country will ever try to use its capacity to wage war, including nuclear war, as an instrument to intimidate others into surrendering their just rights and their cherished liberties. For this would be the surest way to incur the very risk of universal death and destruction which, by the methods of conciliation and accommodation, we are endeavouring earnestly to avoid.


Our country has never had a military tradition and could ill afford one. We live under a Constitution which, when it was promulgated in 1935, became the first in history to renounce war as an instrument of national policy. If we now take up the question of general disarmament, it is only because small countries like ours have at stake not only their own prospects of survival but also their hopes for a more abundant life.


It has, therefore, been immensely heartening for us to observe the great military Powers come closer to an agreement on what has been called the great imperative of our time. It would not seem impossible to reconcile the proposals advanced in this Assembly by Mr. Khrushchev with those advanced by the Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. Total disarmament in four years has to be, with all due respect, regarded as Utopian. Four years is too brief a time within which to sweep aside the habits, instincts, and inherited fears of the whole of human history, and complete and general disarmament is, for the present at least, only the ultimate goal to which all men of peace and good will should strive.


But I trust it is not mere wishful thinking to perceive positive progress toward disarmament by stages and under adequate international control and inspection. The tacit understanding among the nuclear Powers to suspend further tests, the exchange of proposals on the limitation of conventional armaments, the slow but thorough discussion of protection against surprise attacks; all these give us reason to hope that the great military Powers are developing a habit of agreement.


We derive particular satisfaction from the approach suggested by Mr. Selwyn Lloyd when he pointed out that if we can get political settlement it will make agreement on disarmament easier; if we can get an agreement on disarmament, it will make political settlements easier. This, it seems to us, is the most sensible resolution of the vicious circle in which the disarmament question has for so long been caught.


For our part, we feel that a country like the Philippines can best contribute to progress toward disarmament by helping to create and maintain a world opinion favourable to it. It is for this reason that we cannot welcome any addition to the number of states now possessing nuclear weapons. What does it add to the security of either camp, our divided world, to have four instead of three, or five instead of four, among them equipped with these devices, when either of the two principal Powers can now condemn us to annihilation? What will it profit mankind to put more poison into the air that we and our children breathe?


We begrudge the vast treasures that have been spent on being able to kill more men, women and children at one blow, because we believe that all this vast expenditure could better have been spent on being able to keep millions of men, women, and children alive.


We would not appear too demanding. We realize that, in the present situation, great Powers must give priority to their own security. We appreciate the assistance that the Philippines and other countries have already received under the Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance. We are impressed by the activities of the ILO, of FAO, UNESCO, UNICEF and other specialized agencies, and we are particularly pleased that the regional office of WHO has been established in Manila.


Perhaps this is not an entirely inappropriate occasion to suggest at the same time that the benefits of these technical assistance programmes to the peoples who are their beneficiaries could be substantially increased if, without sacrificing efficiency, the expenses of their administration and operation could be reduced.


It might be desirable to assign and recruit technicians for service under these programmes from among the nationals of the recipient country or region concerned. In the Philippines, at least, we feel that, at the present time, there are sufficient technicians among our own people, properly trained at home and abroad, who could be used for the purposes of these programmes so long as sufficient funds are made available to them.


The Special Fund established at the thirteenth session of the General Assembly is now in actual operation. The less-developed countries, including the Philippines, look to it with hope because it attempts to carry into the new field of economic and financial assistance the measures of technical aid which were provided under the previously existing programmes.

One of the two outstanding achievements of our time, no less important than the progress in the nuclear and inter-space sciences, is the accelerated pace of the liberation and emancipation of subject or dependent peoples everywhere. In a little over a decade since the end of the Second World War, the resurgence of the peoples of Asia and the emergence of the peoples of Africa has led to the liberation in rapid succession of no less than six hundred million dependent peoples, or approximately one-fourth of the human race. The trend of developing events would indicate that sooner or later, perhaps within the next five or ten years, some two hundred million more who still remain under political subjection will be set free.

The truly revolutionary element in this movement is that, in nearly all cases of national liberation since the end of the Second World War, the result was achieved by just, peaceful and democratic means. The Philippines, which was the first country in modern history to win its freedom and independence by peaceful agreement with the sovereign Power, is thus committed by its own historic experience to support the just aspirations of all peoples to have a life and destiny of their own.

In the same spirit, the Philippines wishes to express profound concern over the fate of two countries of Asia, namely Korea and Viet-Nam, which continue to be divided and partitioned. We would like to express the hope that the peoples of these countries will be afforded a just opportunity to achieve national unification, by peaceful and democratic means, and that they may soon be permitted to join us as Members of the United Nations.

The Philippines will continue to lend its support to all measures that will enhance the dignity and worth of the human person and to help ensure that men may live in larger freedom and in full enjoyment of fundamental human rights. To this end, my delegation will co-operate toward the early conclusion of United Nations action on the draft International Covenants on Human Rights. We adhere, as heretofore, to our well known position that freedom of the Press and of information is the touchstone of all the other freedoms for which the United Nations has always stood.


We, therefore, welcome the decision to discuss the draft Convention on Freedom of Information. Furthermore, we welcome the inclusion in the agenda of the fourteenth session of the item on the Draft Declaration of the Rights of the Child.


The Philippines will continue likewise to support the programme of the Secretary-General in the matter of advisory services in the field of human rights. [A/4132, p.49]


In the legal field, my Government has always viewed with favour the establishment of a multilateral convention on diplomatic intercourse and immunities. The present usages and practices vary from country to country, thereby at times causing confusion. A convention will not only help secure the greatest possible uniformity in those usages and practices, but will also help to promote better relations among States.


Subject to certain reservations, the draft Articles on Diplomatic Intercourse and Immunities which were prepared by the International Law Commission during its tenth session are considered by my Government as a sufficient working basis for the formulation of a convention on the subject.


We in Asia and in the other less-developed regions hope and expect that the sun of peace that is dawning on the summits of power will eventually warm and comfort the humble and the poor of the world.


We are happy to join our President, in hoping that this will come to be known as the Assembly of peace. We welcome the growing agreement of the principal military Powers to co-operate in making that noble wish come true.


We are ready, within the limits of our modest resources, to work with all for a peace of reconciliation, a peace of general progress and a peace of justice and liberty."	1959-10-01
Francisco Delgado	UNGA 15	"I should like to begin this statement by expressing the sincere feeling of gratification which the Philippine delegation and I personally share with others over Mr. Bolands election to the presidency of the Assembly. We see in him a worthy embodiment of the sterling qualities of the Irish nation, whose fierce love of liberty the whole world has long held in deep respect and admiration. We hope that with him at the helm the ship of the United Nations will successfully weather the storms of angry debate that have developed here, and avoid the shoals of dangerous conflict that lie across its course. May it eventually reach, under his steady hand, the haven of harmony and reconciliation.


We also welcome the representatives of the newly independent countries that have recently joined the growing family of the United Nations. Their presence here today is an eloquent tribute to the understanding and good will of the metropolitan Powers concerned as well as to the efforts of the United Nations to promote and defend the freedom of peoples everywhere.


The presence among us of many of the worlds great leaders has given a new dimension to the deliberations of the General Assembly. Despite some discouraging evidence to the contrary, we remain hopeful that they will apply their personal prestige and broad experience of statesmanship to bring about a heightened sense of sobriety and responsibility in the deliberations of this developing parliament of man and federation of the world.


We live in an age of revolutionary change in science and technology and in the social and economic life of nations. We live in a world which is seeking mightily to transcend itself. Such a situation, while productive of hope, is nevertheless fraught with grave dangers which we need to master quickly if we are to survive and realize our larger goals.


My country shares the universal desire for a lasting peace and a more abundant life. Peace is supremely important to all of us because it can mean the difference between survival and annihilation. But it is particularly indispensable to the developing nations like mine, because there are so many things that wait to be done. The economic and social impulse in our lands remains to be fulfilled. We want to educate our children, to stamp out ancient plagues, to till our lands that have lain fallow, to provide useful work for every able-bodied citizen, to produce more food, clothing and shelter for all our people.


This is why the Philippines attaches great importance to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. We have pledged ourselves to the pursuit of peacea peace of dignity, of friendship, of honour and of justice for all mankind. We shall always strive to help the United Nations achieve these goals. But while we are profoundly dedicated to peace, we categorically reject a peace of submission imposed by the powerful upon the weak.

In the face of the perils of thermonuclear war, our first and foremost duty is to find quickly a practical way to prevent it. There is a role which the smaller nations can perform to this end through the exercise of the power of moral persuasion. Those who in cynical disbelief prefer to speak of the ""naked realities of power"" would do well to study the record of the General Assembly. Lacking the physical power to impose its decisions, it has yet been able to fashion effective solutions by sheer moral strength to many a grave crisis in recent history. As we meet today, that strength has increased. We strongly hope that it will be used to the fullest in this Assembly in the same responsible manner as before.

It is in this spirit that I should like to state the views of my delegation on some of the important questions before the Assembly.

We are convened this year in an atmosphere of unprecedented anxiety. If the situation permitted a jest we would say that the Assembly appears suddenly to have lost its taste for moderate sentiments. No stronger words have been spoken nor more bitter feelings exposed for public inspection than during the past two weeks of debate in this body. We recognize that this has a certain therapeutic value and that its cleansing effect on the raw sources of our emotions should then enable us to consider in a calmer frame of mind the grave problems which confront us. Even as we speak, we hear the familiar but urgent admonition to pause, to consider, to reflect. Our problems are far too grave to be obscured by issues of lesser moment.

In our view, two main problems overshadow all others. The first is the question of disarmament, together with the related problem of utilizing the most advanced scientific techniques for peaceful purposes only. The second is the raising of living standards in the less-developed areas of the world. In the solution of the first problem lies our only hope for human survival; in the solution of the second, our only hope of surviving as free men.

Last spring we pinned our hopes for a relaxation of tension between the great Powers on the Summit Conference which was to be held in Paris. While it would have been extravagant to expect agreement on general and complete disarmament, we nonetheless hoped that a beginning would be made toward that ultimate goal. Some positive progress toward disarmament by stages under adequate international control and inspection, a tacit understanding among the nuclear Powers to suspend further tests, the consideration of proposals on the limitation of conventional armaments, the thorough discussion of the problem of protection against surprise attacksall these were within the realm of the attainable at the Summit Conference. The existing cold war could have been subjected to the warmer winds of conciliation, accommodation and compromise.

Today, the evidence before our eyes offers scant comfort. The dialogue between East and West which was sharply broken in Paris has not been resumed. So long as this condition obtains, the present atmosphere of crisis will persist. Meanwhile, as we mark time on the great issues of peace and survival, some unsuspected action arising from error or miscalculation could plunge the whole world into sudden and total destruction.

Clearly, a start must be made somewhere. Time, normally a great healer, may in this instance serve merely to harden attitudes and positions. Therefore, we shall support any unselfish initiative towards the re-establishment of contact between the great Powers principally involved, which could lead to the resumption of the interrupted negotiations on disarmament. In accordance with this view, my delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution submitted by the delegations of India, Indonesia, Ghana, the United Arab Republic and Yugoslavia [see A/4522], together with such amendments as may be acceptable to the majority.

We cannot stress too strongly the urgency of this problem. The dangers of the fierce competition in nuclear weapons are not merely potential; they are ever present and terrifyingly real. No one can say with accuracy the extent to which the worlds surface, the atmosphere, air and waters have been polluted by deadly radiation arising from past nuclear tests. Nor can anyone surmise, without a shudder, the number of persons now living or still unborn who are doomed to be the innocent victims of our folly.

We favour the reopening of discussions as soon as possible in the Ten-Nation Committee on Disarmament. If for any reason this is no longer practicable, then it might be wise to consider returning the discussions under direct United Nations auspices once more. But we would regard with considerable misgiving the creation of a committee larger than the Ten-Nation Committee. A larger body, in our view, could be expected to exact its own penalties in the form of unwieldy and cumbersome procedures which would tend needlessly to protract debate and to delay rather than to promote agreement.

For, after all, it is not the size or even the composition of the negotiating body which determines the viability of an agreement on disarmament. The sole indispensable condition for such an agreement, as Prime Minister Macmillan has said [877th meeting], is the elimination of fear and suspicion. This can be achieved only through the removal of the fear of surprise attack. This, in turn, is wholly dependent upon equality of sacrifice and equality of security, subject at every stage to verification through a foolproof system of inspection and controls.

The existence of military alliances and foreign bases is a symptom, not a cause, of the prevailing climate of mutual fear and suspicion which bedevils our world. The Philippines is a party to one of these alliances, as was mentioned by the Prime Minister of Australia, and there are American bases on our territory. We have agreed to these solely out of an overriding concern for our national security and in the free exercise of our national sovereignty.

A subject colony for nearly 400 years, invaded and conquered twice within a period of fifty years, and threatened by communist subversion and rebellion within a few years after independence, my country can hardly be said to have a predilection for foreign troops and foreign bases on its territory.

For any country, regardless of ideology, foreign bases constitute a constant source of embarrassment and irritation. To show how far this is true, I need only mention the fact that negotiations between my country and the United States to revise our military bases agreements have been going on for more than two years. We would be happy to be without these bases, but in the context of the situation in our part of the world and in the light of our experience of repeated invasions, we also know that we would not be secure without them. Therefore, we accept their existence as an unavoidable necessity. At the same time, we are determined to make certain that their operation does not infringe on our territorial integrity and national sovereignty.

Our long struggle against foreign domination was inspired, among other things, by an ingrained antipathy towards foreign troops as such. For four centuries and more we had fought against too many of themfirst Spanish, then American, then Japanese. Indeed, our great national leader, the late President Quezon, voicing the anxiety of our people, proposed in the years before the Second World War that an independent Philippine Republic enjoy a status of neutrality guaranteed by the great Powers.

But the realities of the post-war world compelled us to renounce our traditional inclinations. We had to forgo our natural distaste for foreign troops and foreign bases in the interest of our national security and the defence of our freedom. Therefore, we wish to affirm with all possible earnestness that our membership in SEATO and the establishment of United States bases in my country are without any aggressive intent whatever but are motivated solely by the purpose of mutual defence. We recognize that we are a part of a deterrent force against the aggressive intentions of international communism. We are fully aware of the penalties, nay the risks, which we incur by being a part of this deterrent force. And we are not unmindful of the advantages enjoyed by the uncommitted countries whose representatives have spoken to us here of the superior virtues of neutralism.

But we would ask them honestly to consider this thought: that it is precisely the existence of this deterrent capacity of the free world which keeps communism in check and maintains a certain balance of power in the worldand it is therefore a condition of peace, however precarious for the moment it may be. For it is only in this condition of a balance of power that the neutrals can perform their useful role of mediation, conciliation, and compromise. If the free world were to break up its defensive alliances and dismantle its defensive bases in advance of a working agreement on disarmament, the floodgates would be opened and communism would overwhelm the world, including the neutrals themselves.

When the communists stop rattling their atomic rockets and missiles, and we are no longer menaced by communist subversion and attack, there will no longer be any need for defensive military alliances and foreign bases in the Philippines, and they shall be completely dismantled and abolished.

The point is that we cannot all be neutrals; some of us have to perform the unpleasant and even dangerous duty of helping to keep the scales of power in equilibrium. While the scales remain in balance, the neutrals have the opportunity to play their part as peacemakers. The moment those scales are badly tilted one way or the other, the neutrals are not only out of business, but war then becomes inevitable.

I quote from the speech of Mr. Khrushchev on 3 October 1960:

""The real situation in the world today is that the strength of the two greatest Powersthe Soviet Union and the United Statesis at least equal, and that if we also take the other socialist countries into account, as well as the former colonial countries, the peaceable States have on their side not only right and justice, but force!"" [882nd meeting, para. 33].


This is the balance of power of which I have been speaking, and in the judgment of Mr. Khrushchev it is already tilted in favour of his side. If the words of anger and menace which we have heard him speak here have been inspired by his assessment of the present situation, what words and actions are we to expect from him and his allies when they do have an undisputed preponderance of power in the world?

Therefore, as the representative of a country that is openly committed to the side of the free world, I should like to say to our uncommitted friends: we have chosen a policy of commitment according to our best lights and by the same right of self-preservation that you claim for yourselves, which we fully respect. We pray that you may succeed in your efforts to reduce tensions and to remove the danger of war. But so long as such danger exists, we deem it our duty to help keep the world in balance in the perilous present, just as you deem it your duty to help fashion a long-range programme for a just and enduring peace which will be acceptable to all.

The second most vital problem of our time is the urgent need to raise living standards in the less developed areas of the world. The world economic situation continues to present the picture of a worsening imbalance between those who have and those who have not. Roughly two-thirds of the world's population live in the so-called under-developed or less developed areas. They share among themselves just one-sixth of the world's total income. In contrast, one-sixth of the world's population which inhabits the industrialized and highly developed countries earns two-thirds of the worlds total income.

It is for the bridging of the gap between the less developed and the highly developed areas that the United Nations must harness its efforts and resources. Whereas in the past the resources of the under-developed areas were mere objects of exploitation by the colonial and industrial Powers, today we have the opportunity through sustained, cooperative effort to develop such resources for the benefit, in the first instance, of the native inhabitants themselves, and of the rest of the world as a whole.

That the rich countries should assist the poor involves not a matter of charity, but a principle of self-interest, of justice and of peace. It is in the self-interest of the rich, industrial Powers to help the less developed countries because their own economies cannot long survive in isolation amidst the backward, impoverished and unproductive economies of their neighbours. And it is simple justice that the colonial Powers, which for centuries have appropriated the wealth of the subject countries, should restore to the latter a portion of the resources that were extracted from them. Finally, it is truer today than ever before that the world cannot exist half slave to hunger and half free from want.

It is in this spirit that we welcome the powerful support which President Eisenhower has given to the principle of multilateral economic assistance to the less developed countries on a more substantial scale than has heretofore been possible through the United Nations. For it is a fact that for most recipient countries the existing programmes of technical assistance touch merely the surface of their present need; what they require are development funds for projects whose value and feasibility are no longer in doubt. The carrying out of the United States proposal would be a virtual revolution in the field of economic and financial assistance, and it is fortunate that it has been advanced by the country which has most generously contributed to the existing programmes of economic assistance.

I turn now to the question of the Congo (Leopoldville). My delegation voted for the resolution [14'14 (ES-IV)] on this question which was adopted by the fourth emergency special session. We continue to support the right of the Congolese people to work out their destiny in peace and liberty. This right is, and must be, essentially their own. Furthermore, this is merely the corollary of a larger principlenamely, that the liberated peoples of Africa should be allowed to develop their own democratic institutions and to fashion their own future in the manner best suited to their traditions and their needs.

There, in the bustling continent of Africa, the United Nations faces a great challenge and a great opportunity. The challenge is one of assisting the peaceful growth and development of not one, not two, but more than a dozen countries emerging eagerly into freedom, with its attendant responsibilities. The opportunity is one of proving that Africa can be insulated against the clash of embattled ideologies and prevented from becoming one more arena of the cold war.

My Government views the United Nations' efforts in this direction with gratification. It sees also in the resolution on the Congo problem the main outlines of a policy which may be applicable to comparable situations elsewhere that may arise in the future. In the face of an extremely complex and difficult situation, the United Nations forces have been able to restore order to a degree which we hope will soon permit the Congolese people themselves to resolve the personal rivalries and constitutional problems that have so bitterly divided them. Once again, we pay tribute to the scrupulous impartiality with which the Secretary-General has directed the United Nations activities in the Congo. We hope that he will derive increased strength and courage from the powerful endorsement which he has received from the delegations of those countries that have no selfish interests to serve in that unhappy country.

The crisis in the Congo is still far from being solved, however, and the peoples of Africa look to the United Nations for a just and rapid solution. We sustain the view contained in the resolution adopted by the fourth special emergency session to the effect that aid to the Congo should be channelled only through the United Nations. In the same degree that we are resolved to see the last vestiges of Western colonial imperialism eradicated from the Congo, we must make certain that the infiltration there of communist imperialism, whether open or disguised, shall not be permitted. The Congo belongs to the Congolese, and now that they are free, we must help them to resist the onslaughts of a more ruthless form of imperialism than that from which they have just been liberated.

As regards the problem of Algeria, we must express regret that the hopeful initiative which President de Gaulle took early this year, when he publicly affirmed his Government's policy of an ""Algerian Algeria"" through the application of the principle of self-determination, has so far produced no hopeful results. The tragedy of Algeria has so long agitated our hearts and minds that we must press unceasingly for an end to that bloody conflict. The conscience of the French nation itself is being torn cruelly in the face of this six-year-old war whose end is not yet in sight. We must continue to urge a peaceful solution to this problem, such as will fulfil the just aspirations of the Algerian people to freedom and be worthy of the great nation that gave to the world the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and that only this year, in an unparalleled act of renunciation, recognized the independence of thirteen new States in Africa.

No session of the General Assembly has heard more sustained and more vigorous denunciations of Western colonial imperialism than the present one. It is natural that this should be so, for this year, with the recognition of the independence of seventeen countries, we are hearing the death rattle of that imperialism. It is also right and proper that we should heed the warning voiced, among others, by President Sukarno [880th meeting] that we cannot trust this imperialism to die quietly without a further struggle.

All the countries that have been freed from the colonial yoke will need constantly to seek out and destroy within their territories the last remnants of colonial imperialism. They will need to be ever on the alert against the reintroduction of colonial influence and domination through economic devices which are calculated to render ineffectual and meaningless the grant of their political independence. And they will need to develop a sense of their own national dignity which will make impossible the continuation of policies based on race prejudice and discrimination, for the pursuit of policies of economic domination and the persistence of practices of racial discrimination are the twin evils against which the peoples of the newly independent countries must exercise unrelenting vigilance.

Having said this, we should be naive indeed to believe that the worries of the newly independent countries are over. Since subject peoples are familiar with the ways of their former masters, they are well able to recognize the latter's every stratagem to recover the privileges they have renounced. They are therefore prepared to take the necessary steps to combat the devious intentions of their former masters. On the other hand, they are comparative strangers to the more insidious methods by which international communism seeks to subvert their liberties and their institutions. The danger exists, therefore, that they will not be as well prepared to overcome the dangers posed by the new imperialism as they undoubtedly are to combat the menace of the old.

Of these twin dangers we in the Philippines are entitled to speak, for we have known them both. And we can only regret that there has been a tendency to speak here of communist imperialism in muted tones as if it were indiscreet to suggest that, in denouncing the evils of Western colonial imperialism in season and out of season, the communists are merely playing the cunning game of the wolf in sheep's clothing.

We hold no brief for Western colonial imperialism. We were a Spanish colony for nearly four hundred years, and we fared no worse and no better than the other twenty-odd colonies of Spain during the heyday of its imperial glory. Yet, when we consider the history of those four hundred years during which our people rose in rebellion every two or three years, we can yet candidly admit that amid the long litany of evils which colonialism wrought in our country there has remained a residue of good. Upon the basic oriental elements of our native culture, Spain grafted the values of that Latin civilization of which it was the principal bearer to the New World and which now serves as a precious link between us and the twenty republics of that continent.

Above all, it was Spain that gave the peoples of our seven thousand islands, speaking a multitude of languages, a sense of national identity. Philippine nationality was thus forged in the very fire of the fervid colonizing spirit of the Spanish ""conquistadores"", and, when that fire began to die down at last, it was the turn of Philippine nationalism to arise full-blown and victorious.

The story of American rule in the Philippines is well known to all. The Prime Minister of Cuba referred to it in his statement before this Assembly [872nd meeting]. Indeed, it is true that there are significant resemblances between the history of Cuba and that of the Philippines in their relations, first, with Spain and, later, with the United States. But, without denying the expansionist impulse that brought the United States to Cuba and the Philippines at the turn of the century, we Filipinos are more readily able to view our experience in sober and balanced perspective.

The United States came to the Philippines in 1898 in the course of the Spanish-American War. At the time of their arrival, we were on the point of winning our revolutionary struggle against Spain. Our troops were knocking at the very gates of Manila. The United States offered to assist us and we accepted them as allies. Later, however, they decided to occupy our country on the ground that we needed to learn how to govern ourselves. We fought them bitterly for four years, because we believed that we were well able to govern ourselves, having already established a revolutionary government of our own under a Constitution every bit as modern and liberal as the United States Constitution itself. In the end, we bowed to superior force, and we laid down our arms. In 1916, the United States Congress passed a law promising to grant independence to the Philippines as soon as a stable government was established. In response to the unremitting clamour of our people for independence, the United States Congress passed another law in 1934 definitely committing the United States to grant our independence after a transition period of ten years following the establishment of a fully autonomous Commonwealth. On 4 July 1946, shortly after the end of the war in the Pacific, the promise was fulfilled to the letter, and the Philippines became independent. By this unprecedented act, the United States set in motion a peaceful procedure for the grant of independence to subject peoples that other colonial Powers were later obliged to follow.

Was United States colonial rule more virtuous than most? That may be a matter of opinion, but the fact of the matter is that the United States, during the forty years of its domination of the Philippines, did initiate a number of policies unorthodox for colonialism. They helped us to establish a public school system so that, by the end of the United States rgime, the Philippines had one of the highest literacy rates of any country in Asia. They set up a programme for the advanced education of hundreds of Filipino students in American universitiesa policy which anticipated by fifty years the present Fulbright programme of exchange of students. They constructed hospitals and stamped out epidemic diseases. They built roads and bridges and developed agriculture and industry. They permitted our people the full enjoyment of civil liberties. They developed and strengthened our democratic institutions. By introducing English common law to our country, they enabled us to fashion a legal system which is unique in its judicious blending of the best in Roman civil law with the best in Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence.

Of course, the motive of economic gain was not lacking. United States investment capital came to set up essential public utilities and help us develop our natural resources. But the truth is that United States investments never reached our country in amounts sufficient for our needs and requirements. Since independence, we have been unable to attract United States capital in sufficient amounts despite special inducements of various kinds. Fortunately, Filipino capital has begun to fill the vacuum and, as the process continues, our own citizens are gaining control of an ever-increasing portion of the national economy. This process is being encouraged by a surging spirit of economic nationalism which has taken hold of our people as they realize that their political independence will mean nothing unless it is buttressed by economic freedom and self-sufficiency. This is the new spirit of nationalism which today animates the administration of President Garcia.

We are confident that our relations with the United States, now that we are independent, will continue to be inspired by a spirit of mutual respect and consideration. The Americans are no saints, but this you can say of them: as ""imperialists"" they proved to be more inept than their rivals in the game; they allowed us too many liberties; and now that we are independent, they know better than to disregard our opinions or to ignore our rights. Here is one little interesting detail: you can discuss, argue and talk back to the Americans, as we have discussed, argued and talked back to them during all the years of our subjection, and since thenwithout being slapped down or getting shot at dawn. One wonders, sometimes, what would happen to a Latvian or an Estonian or a Lithuanian who talked back to Mr. Khrushchev. We know, of course, what happened to the Hungarians who did just that."	1960-10-05
Joaquin Miguel Elizalde	UNGA 16	"On this our first opportunity to address the General Assembly, I should like, in the name of the Philippine delegation, to ex- press to Mr. Slim my heartiest congratulations on his election to the Presidency of the sixteenth ses- sion. We are extremely pleased at the election for the first time of a leader from the continent of Africa to preside over the deliberations of this chamber. We are confident that with his wisdom and experience, tact and proven diplomatic ability, our session will be fruitful and constructive.


We likewise commend the representative of Ireland, Ambassador Boland, President of the fifteenth session of the General Assembly, for the out- standing manner with which he presided over the meetings of that session.


Recently, a new sovereign nation was born. It is always a deep satisfaction to the Philippines to be able to participate in the admission of additional Members to this Organization. We welcome Sierra Leone. Its presence here is another token of the extension of the frontiers of freedom and liberty. It is the hope of the Philippine delegation that other countries, including Algeria, will soon find their respective seats in the Assembly.


We begin our work in the shadow of a tragic eventthe death in Africa of our distinguished Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjold. He died in the line of duty and in the service of peace.


Mr. Hammarskjold was a man of exceptional qualities, and it is hard to find his equal to cope with the difficulties of the present time. That is why his death poses a problem that involves the very existence of this Organization. He was not only a diplomat and distinguished economist, but also an exemplary administrator.


The functions of the Secretary-General comprise not only the execution of the mandates of the General Assembly, but also the effective, complete and orderly administration of all United Nations offices and personnel. By express provision of the Charter the Secretary-General is the chief administrative officer of the United Nations. The Charter likewise provides that in the performance of his duties the Secretary-General or any member of his staff ""shall not seek or receive instructions from any government or from any other authority external to the Organization"". Finally, the Secretary-General and his staff are enjoined to ""refrain from any action which might reflect on their position as international officials responsible only to the Organization"".


As a corollary to the foregoing, and to preserve the independence and integrity of the Secretariat, every Member of the United Nations is under obligation ""to respect the exclusively international character of  the staff and not to seek to influence them in the discharge of their responsibilities"".


We believe that there is a consensus in this body that Mr. Hammarskjold was performing all the duties of the position of Secretary-General with exceptional ability and efficiency and that he helped in the smooth functioning of the United Nations in its relations with all specialized agencies and financial institutions related thereto. Unfortunately, we now find ourselves facing an unexpected situation and in consequence we have to meet new realities. Our distinguished Secretary-General is here no more, and it must be the concern of all the Members of the United Nations to give continuity to the position as well as to the authority and duties of Secretary-General as envisioned in the Charter. Our delegation is of the opinion that it would be advisable for us in this new task to maintain the organizational system which has been in effect since the founding of the United Nations, which has been proven to most to be both effective and practical. Naturally, we are opposed to any division or dilution of the powers of the Secretary-General because it would reduce the effectiveness of the office and lead toward disorganized management. We are solidly and unreservedly behind the continuance of a single executive for the United Nations Secretariat responsible only to the Organization as a whole. It is our firm conviction that the Secretariat should be insulated from power conflicts and political struggles. We feel that the selection of a successor to Mr. Hammarskjold is of extreme urgency and must be resolved speedily. Immediate action should result in continued smooth functioning of the General Assembly, its Committees and the United Nations in general. This would also effectively prevent the disintegration of the Organization for lack of a head, administrative direction and control.


It is most important and even essential, therefore, in the light of what has just been said, that the person assuming; this post should be both seasoned and mature in the diplomatic and political sense and at the same time a proven executive administrator.

Countries like ours are ever more interested in the immediate solution of this problem, for the position of Secretary-General has been an instrument to harmonize the actions and differences of big and small nations in the achievement of the aims and purposes of the United Nations. We are, therefore, deeply concerned over the divergence of opinions which is causing the delay in the selection of a Secretary-General.

The Philippine delegation, in the interest of an effective, responsive, and impartial administration of the United Nations, would support any proposal which would take into account the provisions of the Charter. We hope that whatever arrangements are made to fill the vacancy, the staff of the Secretariat as well as the Members of the United Nations will recognize the full authority of the incumbent to make such decisions as are implicit in his position as executive head of this world organization.

We recognize that there is a need for studies to be made with a view to effecting changes in some sections of the Secretariat to make it conform to the growth of membership and the expansion of its work and functions. But we must reject any formula which, even by the slightest implication, would lead to interference with the Secretary-General or the functions of the personnel of the Secretariat by any country or group of countries.

It has become evident to all that the increase in the membership of the United Nations requires that the present composition of the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council be reviewed. Whereas for the last fifteen years the total membership of the United Nations has doubled, this growth has not been reflected in these Councils. The Philippine delegation takes the position that the new countries which now comprise a large proportion of the total membership, and older Members which have not had adequate opportunity to serve, should be given a voice in these important Councils. An increase in the membership of the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council will doubtless make these bodies more realistic and responsible in carrying out their important functions effectively.

In recent weeks some of the major Powers have embarked upon a resumption of nuclear testing. This resumption has indeed created anxiety, if not distress, all over the world. In the course of their statements before this body, some delegations have informed the Assembly of the alarming increase in the intensity of radioactive fallout recorded in their countries since the resumption of atmospheric tests. It is known that such radioactive fallout endangers the health and life of mankind and that no adequate protection has so far been devised. Radiation is universally recognized as a hazard to human life, and all of us must be convinced that the perilous consequences of nuclear testing could become a scourge to mankind.

We, therefore, join those delegations which have already taken the rostrum in appealing to the Powers concernedwhether conducting tests or just preparing to do so, in the atmosphere, in outer space, or elsewhereto impose upon themselves voluntarily and in the interest of the world a moratorium on any and all kinds of tests. It is to be hoped that the overwhelming expression here by the Members toward such an end will create a new consciousness of the imperative need for the immediate cessation of all tests.

In discussing the question of disarmament, we have in our minds the principle in the Philippine Constitution outlawing war as an instrument of national policy. Before proceeding further, we are pleased to commend the address of President Kennedy of the United States to this Assembly outlining a comprehensive programme towards world disarmament. He also gave us a picture of the troubles of this world which could help focus attention on the magnitude and urgency of the task of building for peace.

There are many trouble spots in various parts of the world today, and Southeast Asia, which includes my country, the Philippines, is no exception. Here, as in other parts of the world, the big nations are the main protagonists, but the smaller countries within these troubled areas are in constant danger of being engulfed at short notice. We see today uncertainty in political and military conditions in several countries in Southeast Asia. The dangers of war are becoming apparent, and national upheavals are growing in alarming proportions. Such a situation compels the countries within the region to devote substantial portions of their resources to their own defense and provide safeguards against infiltration and subversion. The result of this is that resources which could otherwise be used for much-needed economic and social progress have to be wasted in military spending without tangible benefits to the entire population.

At this juncture, some delegations have expressed the view that nuclear testing, as it is now being carried out, must be related closely to the arms race. It has been stated, furthermore, that these tests may even be considered as a prelude to the production of arms and weapons more deadly and destructive than the ones now existing.

We feel that, unless and until the big Powers agree to disarm, many millions will go down the drain not only by limitless spending by the strong Powers but also by wasted effort on the part of the smaller nations. Considerations of this and a similar nature have impelled some countries, including my own, to enter into defense arrangements with stronger friendly Powers for purposes of protection. Pending the advent of the climate of peace which is long awaited, the Philippines has seen fit to permit the establishment of bases by a friendly Power as a deterrent to war and as a protection against surprise attack. Let it be known, however, that these bases have been agreed upon to be purely for defensive purposes and have been negotiated freely and voluntarily, with full respect for the sovereign powers of the parties concerned.

It has been said here that ""the weapons of war must be abolished before they abolish us."" With this in view, we join other delegations in an appeal for a renewal of honest efforts aimed at complete and general disarmament under international control. We endorse the general principles arrived at by both the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. We express the hope that these general principles will be implemented.

We will support any proposal intended to prevent and prohibit the transfer or further dissemination of nuclear weapons from one country to another. As a stage in the process of industrialization, we should like, of course, to see the atom harnessed for useful and constructive purposes. We should like to see mankind closer to the era of Atoms for Peace.

Like most of the new and small nations, the Philippines is exerting every possible effort towards an extensive development of its resources. Through international cooperation and the partnership of domestic and foreign capital, our industrial capacity has increased substantially in the last decade. It is with satisfaction that I state here that the present trend towards industrialization and economic and social development in the Philippines is due mainly and in great measure to the wisdom, vision, and dynamic ""economic nationalism"" of His Excellency, Carlos P. Garcia, President of the Philippines. However, like other countries not yet fully developed economically, we still depend mainly on the export of raw materials for our income and foreign exchange earnings. Consequently, we have not moved far enough away from our original position of dependency, continuing to be subject to the requirements, controls, and inordinate fluctuations of the markets dominated by the industrialized and richer countries. In such circumstances, heavy dependence upon the export of raw materials has slowed down the social and economic progress in many parts of the world and not less in our own country. The people in these raw-material producing countries are forced by economic circumstances to suffer low standards of living. Accordingly, their wages and per capita incomes are out of proportion compared with the higher individual incomes prevailing in the highly industrialized countries. It is true that during the last decade the United Nations and the specialized agencies, as well as financing and lending institutions related to the United Nations, have extended assistance for the industrial and economic development of the less developed areas. Sadly enough, the conditions prevailing in such countries have not changed as much as would be desirable, and the gap between the industrialized and unindustrialized countries not only has not been narrowed but, in general, has been aggravated.

It is often suggested that industrialization is the most effective means of hastening the economic development of the underdeveloped and less developed countries. But it must also be realized that in the initial stages, any plan for industrial development brings about serious financial problems, even though they can be expected to taper off in the course of time. Likewise, the general theory of replacing imports through industrialization and the production of equivalent goods is an excellent one, but this per se gives rise to special problems of financing. Invariably, therefore, the only recourse open to the countries confronted with these and allied problems is to seek loans, the heavy amortization and interest charges of which, at least temporarily, weaken their economic structures. We feel that present borrowing facilities available to Members of the United Nations are by no means sufficient to meet the requirements and the growing demands of smaller and new nations.

We all believe in the necessity of an expanded interchange of goods, commodities, and services among all nations. But we must realize that, without improved world conditions, free communications, and elimination of barriers, the accomplishment of such objectives does not appear likely in the foreseeable future. In recent years, we have seen the emergence and establishment of regional economic blocs and groupings. But until we see them working in harmony, the expansion of trade will be a myth and, therefore, the interchange of commerce must continue at its present limited pace.

I wish to express my appreciation to the representatives of Malaya and Thailand for making reference to the joint efforts of their countries, together with mine, in establishing the Association of South-East Asia. The basic objective of this Association is to foster closer economic, social, and scientific cooperation between the members and thus enable them better to comprehend their mutual problems. Philippine participation in this Association is under the personal direction of our Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Serrano. We hope for great success in this endeavour.

The position of the Philippines on questions regarding the rights of nations and peoples to self-determination is well known. Fortunately, the Philippines achieved its independence through a peaceful process and our transition to sovereignty was orderly, resulting from normal international negotiations.

Our record in the United Nations shows that we have joined many nations in the espousal of proposals for the termination, as speedily as possible, of all traces of colonialism. Naturally enough, we are against the maintenance in one form or another of colonialism or neo-colonialism in any part of the world. We strongly believe that peoples in every continent are entitled to live freely and without interference or pressure from any external source and to exercise their right of self-determination as to their political status. At this juncture, it is well to recall the Charter, which enjoins all men irrespective of race, religion, creed, or color to develop friendly relations among themselves and to ""practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours.""

The Charter likewise enjoins the people all over the world to ""establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and in international law can be maintained."" Viewing the Berlin question in this context, the Philippines can only reaffirm its conviction of the necessity of traditional respect for international treaties and commitments. We here express the hope that the parties concerned should find their way clear to peaceful negotiations and settlement.

Our respect for the provisions of the Charter constrains the Philippine delegation to continue, in present circumstances, to oppose the membership in this Organization of Communist China, which has flouted the cause of peace, has challenged and fought against the collective will of the United Nations, and has, through aggression, infiltration, and subversion, disregarded the peace and territorial integrity of its neighbours and of many other countries.

It is our hope that, under your wise guidance and able direction, we shall move together towards harmony and peace."	1961-10-17
Emmanuel Pelaez	UNGA 17	"I should like to take this opportunity to extend to you, Mr. President, the warm congratulations of the Government of the Philippines, as well as my own as leader of the Philippine delegation, on your election as President of the seventeenth session of the General Assembly. Your election confers a highly deserved honour not only upon your own person, but also upon Asia, which claims you as one of its most eminent citizens, and particularly upon your country, Pakistan, to which the Philippines is bound by strong ties of friendship and common purpose. We are confident that your well-known humane outlook and your balanced view of the perennial problems of mankind will contribute greatly to whatever measure of success our deliberations may achieve.


 I should also like to congratulate the four newest Members of the United Nations: the Kingdom of Burundi, Jamaica, the Republic of Rwanda, and the State of Trinidad and Tobago. We welcome them most heartily and wish them well as they begin a great adventure in that taxing but rewarding exercise of freedom and responsibility.


My delegation attaches great importance to this annual exchange of views at the beginning of each session of the United Nations General Assembly. At a time such as the present, when vast changes are taking place with bewildering speed in the political, economic and social fields, it is essential that Member nations should know the sentiments and the thinking of their fellow Members on the grave problems that beset out international community, their approach to their own most pressing tasks, their hopes and even their fears for the future. Only in this unique international forum can we have a comprehensive view of the state of the world and consider particular problems in perspective. Only here can nations, large and small, exchange views and recount significant experiences, thus contributing to the mutual understanding so indispensable to the United Nations, and to the fund of knowledge and information which Member nations may draw from, and perhaps find useful, in formulating their own policies and programmes of action. It is in this spirit that I should like to tell the Assembly something about the recent experience of my country, particularly in the field of economic and social developments.


The Republic of the Philippines, whose revolutionary beginnings go back to 12 June 1898, when the Filipino people proclaimed their independence from Spain and established the first Asian republic, has always been a democratic State, with a government freely elected by, and fully responsible to, the people, under a Constitution which guarantees their liberties and ensures that the State shall function for their welfarenot the other way round.


In November 1961, the Filipino people, in the free and peaceful exercise of their right of suffrage, elected a new administration under the leadership of President Diosdado Macapagal. I wish to state that this change of administration has not brought about fundamental changes in our foreign policy. Certainly, it has not diminished our faith in and our reliance upon the United Nations.


Within our borders, we Filipinos are seeking to translate into reality our ideal of a progressive and prosperous society whose members enjoy the fullest possible measure of freedom and opportunity. To this end the Government adopted last January an integrated five-year programme of social and economic development which we are now implementing with all the resources at our disposal.


In relation to our modest means, this programme is of such magnitude that it is bound to consume the best part of the national effort in the years to come. The primary responsibility for its achievement is ours; international participation, important as it is, will play only a secondary part. We are therefore striving to release and harness the creative energies of our people by offering to them every inducement to individual initiative in a system of free enterprise. Wherever appropriate, we are seeking to decentralize the massive concentration, dating back to colonial times, of governmental power and authority at the top. We have begun to extend to the villages in our predominantly agricultural countryside a greater measure of authority and responsibility, including the administration of local affairs by the people themselves.


Parallel measures are being taken to give maximum play to enterprise in commerce and industry. In short, our whole approach is premised on the conviction that an unregimented society will, in the long run, provide our people with the most effective instrument for the attainment of their prosperity in freedom.


Our preoccupation with problems of internal development should not be construed as denoting indifference to international problems. It arises rather from our firm belief that the best contribution that a small or middle-sized country can make to international peace and stability is to put its own house in order. 


As President Macapagal of the Philippines has said in a recent statement:

	""Our aspiration is ... for the Filipino people themselves to fulfil their obligation and play their role among nations in good faith and with honour and, by the efficient and effective administration of their affairs and the solution of their national problems on the basis of freedom, prove that democracy can work successfully in an Asian country like the Philippines as an effective instrument for the prosperity of the masses of the peoplean achievement which will be the Philippines' best contribution to the freedom, peace and welfare of humanity.""


This is so because we believe that, to the extent that we achieve political, economic and social progress at home, we strengthen our ability to withstand political subversion, economic penetration, and outright attempts at domination. At the same time, we acquire the capacity to assist other countries and to participate actively in the collective effort to expand the area of security and contentment in the world.


In line with this twofold concept, the Philippines is not only putting its house in order; it has also joined hands with its close friends and neighbours, Malaya and Thailand, in a co-operative venture for mutual assistance in the economic, social and scientific fields through the establishment of the Association of Southeast Asian States, better known as ASA. This strictly non-political organization is taking the first modest steps towards what we believe to be an essential and inevitable development in Asia, a development already foreshadowed in other areas of the world, namely, the augmentation of national efforts by freely agreed and mutually beneficial modes of regional co-operation.


In the field of international security, the position of the Philippines remains basically unchanged. We are committed in the sense of belonging to a collective security organizationSEATOoperating within the framework of the United Nations Charter for mutual protection against the menace of Communist subversion and thinly disguised aggression, which is very real and pressing in Asia today. The cases of Korea, Tibet and Laos, the attacks against the Republic of Viet-Nam, the continuing violation of the borders of India, all these attest to the fact that aggression is still rampant in Asia.


At this very moment, the Republic of Viet-Nam is fighting for its life against a relentless communist invasion from the North. An uncertain peace has returned to the Kingdom of Laos, but recent reports on the non-withdrawal of foreign communist elements from that country cannot but cause us grave concern. The Philippines more than ever feel the need, in the words of President Macapagal, to maintain constant vigilance, to take nothing for granted, to unmask communist deception and resist communist subversion and aggression wherever these manifest themselves.


These same considerations impel us to maintain our opposition to the admission of Communist China into the United Nations. Since Communist China invaded Korea and fought United Nations forces defending that country, far from becoming a peace-loving State within the definition of the Charter, it has continued to commit acts of aggression and subversion against neighbouring countries in Asia.


Let me turn now to the United Nations. Admittedly, it suffers from deficiencies and weaknesses. But rather than discourage us, this fact should move us all to persevere in strengthening it. This task embraces three main aspects: first, the maintenance of the integrity of the Organization; secondly, support of specific United Nations measures bearing directly on the prevention of war or the maintenance of peace; and thirdly, support of the work of the United Nations and its specialized agencies in the promotion of human rights and of progress in the economic and social fields.

The maintenance of the integrity of the United Nations Organization is of immediate concern to this Assembly. The term of office of the Acting Secretary-General is due to expire next April. A new election for the post is in prospect. This has given rise to renewed efforts to alter the structure of the Secretariat by replacing the present incumbent with a three-man board representing the three main political divisions in the world today. We have opposed this proposal, and we continue to oppose it. We shall not belabour the arguments in support of our stand. We would make only one observation: the ""troika"" proposal would surely introduce the cold war into the one organ of the United Nations where it should at all cost be kept outthe United Nations administrative machinery.

The Acting Secretary-General, U Thant, has discharged his responsibilities with competence, distinction and an admirable dedication to the ideals and principles of the United Nations. The Philippines is prepared to support any move for his continuance in office for a full term.

Of pressing concern to this Assembly is the extension of full support to the specific peace-keeping efforts which it has itself authorized. Foremost among these are the United Nations operations in the Congo and in the Middle East. In the light of the recent advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the matter, we earnestly hope that all Member countries will not heed the appeal of the Secretary-General to contribute their share of the cost of these operations [A/5161]. The Philippines is not only prepared to pay its share of these costs, but it has also pledged to subscribe $750,000 worth of the bond issue which the United Nations has been constrained to float as a stop-gap arrangement.

If in the past we have stubbornly faced frustrations and failures, we must now as stubbornly appeal for a workable agreement on disarmament and the prohibition of the use of nuclear and thermo-nuclear weapons. And now that the conquest of space has become a reality, we must, with equal insistence, ask that the Powers concerned arrive at an agreement to ensure that outer space shall not be used for military or warlike purposes. While the ultimate decisions on these grave issues lie in the hands of the great Powers, their consequences will affect all countries and are therefore of universal concern. We will state our position on these questions in detail before the appropriate committee of the Assembly.

It is noteworthy that the two most revolutionary developments in human knowledge in recent history, the splitting of the atom and the breakthrough in space technology and planetary exploration, should have been born of the stress of war or near-war, and that both should hold for mankind the promise, either of unimagined improvements in human welfare or of the extinction of human life, depending on whether they are put to peaceful or to warlike uses. The choice of which end these momentous scientific developments will ultimately serve should rest with the collective will of the United Nations. But, as in the question of disarmament, at the moment the fateful choice lies in the hands of a few great Powers. It is our prayerful hope, as it must be the hope of all responsible Members of this Assembly, that these Powers will opt for peace and a more abundant life for humanity.

In nuclear science we have already seen, in the few short years since 1955, the tremendous benefits that can accrue to mankind from a scientific discovery initially intended to perfect the weapons of war. There is no valid reason why the more recent developments in space research and exploration cannot evolve similar benefits. There is no insuperable obstacle, given the collective will of the nations here represented, to the deliberate re-direction of both nuclear and space development to the betterment of man and the world in which he lives. The Philippines unequivocally aligns itself with those nations that believe in harnessing our new and revolutionary scientific knowledge of the atom and of space to the over-riding need for improving the lot of man on this planet.

My delegation has always attached the highest importance to the work of the United Nations in the promotion of fundamental human rights and of economic and social progress. We are pleased to note the significant achievements recorded in some aspects of this work during the past year.

We are particularly happy over the continuing progress in the elimination of the remaining vestiges of colonialism all over the world. We have already welcomed four new Members during this Assembly; we look forward to the admission of Algeria and Uganda before the conclusion of this session. We know from our own experience as a former colony that nations, like individuals, can give of their best to the community only in conditions of freedom and dignity.

We have placed on record our gratification over the peaceful settlement of the West Irian question. It is our earnest hope that the spirit of accommodation that led to the settlement of this long-standing dispute will likewise prevail in the settlement of similar problems.

I have in mind particularly the claim of my Government to the territory of North Borneo which was annexed by the British Crown in 1946. This is neither the time nor the place to go into the details of this question, but we stand on what we consider to be valid legal and historical grounds. Our claim has been put forward with sincere assurances of our desire that the issue should be settled by peaceful means, and without prejudice to the exercise of the right of self-determination by the inhabitants of North Borneo, preferably under United Nations auspices.

We have always had the most friendly relations with the United Kingdom and others who may be interested in this question. We are determined to maintain their friendship, which we cherish. I should like to emphasize, however, that it is the intention of my Government to press this claim amicably but firmly until a just and satisfactory settlement shall have been reached.

We are prepared to assist in every way we can in the orderly liquidation of the remaining pockets of colonialism in the world. We believe that the early completion of this historic process is indispensable to the attainment of lasting peace.

We should also like to see the extirpation of remaining practices of racial discrimination, so repugnant to the principles of our Charter and so dangerously ananchronistic at this time, when the mainstream of history is moving inexorably towards freedom and equality for an-men and nations. We are particularly desirous of seeing the most extreme and blatant form of racial discrimination, apartheid, eliminated in South and South West Africa.

In the face of repeated censures by the General Assembly and indeed by all civilized opinion, South Africa remains impenitent. But how long does South Africa think this deliberate violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms can continue without exacting the bitter penalty of violence? It is inconceivable that repression, no matter how stringent, can abate the fierce desire for human status of the indigenous population of South Africa, now that they have been exposed to the bracing winds of freedom sweeping the world. As long as apartheid exists it will continue to be a potent threat to international peace.

The same deplorable situation exists in the mandate of South West Africa. That the problem has assumed serious proportions is evident from the report of the Special Committee on South West Africa. The report states:
""... it is quite clear that unless an early satisfactory settlement of this question were made, the situation could result in a serious political disaster with far-reaching consequences"" [A/5212, para. 80].

The fact that this conclusion was reached unanimously by the Committee apparently does not disturb South Africa in the least. On the contrary, it has assumed an even more defiant posture, seeking perhaps in this way to mask from itself and from the world the true nature of the festering situation in South West Africa. We regret to have to say this, but how else are we to interpret the tactics by which South Africa now seeks to divert attention from the conditions in her mandate? Is it perhaps because it is unable to deny the ugly evidence of apartheid in South West Africa, and now, in a desperate effort to sway world opinion in its favour, has chosen instead to question the integrity and sully the reputation of those whose revulsion against apartheid is well known?

But we refuse to be deceived. We wish to state here our considered view that, unless South Africa co-operates in discharging its obligations in South West Africa as required by the Charter, then the time has indeed come for the Assembly, in the words of the Special Committee, to take firm and decisive action. We will abide by the wishes of the majority, noting also that as time passes the chances for alternative peaceful solutions progressively diminish. If, as has been pointed out, the only remaining alternative is to revoke South Africa's mandate and transfer administration of South West Africa to the United Nations, we shall be prepared to support this course of action.

My delegation would like to focus attention on another threat to peace arising from the growing gap between the economically developed and the developing countries. This gap has been increasing in past years and it is one of the most challenging tasks of the United Nations to arrest this trend and to evolve constructive measures to reverse it.

The Philippines therefore views with appreciation the growing commitment of the United Nations to the cause of balanced, comprehensive, and massive attack on the problem of economic and social development of the developing nations.

My country has been committed since 1935 to the need for national planning, and more recently to the equally important need for the systematic training of manpower resources and the mobilization of savings as basic instruments for economic and social progress. Thus the Philippines finds it only natural and proper that it should subscribe to the objectives of the United Nations Development Decade and to hope, in concert with the vast majority of the Member countries, that the various instruments proposed to achieve those objectives be forged carefully and made ready for effective use in due time. We hope that significant progress will be attained without unnecessary delay in providing adequate sources and means of assistance to developing countries.

We realize, of course, that in the face of the immensity of needs on the part of developing countries, the United Nations resources for assistance would be relatively meagre. For this reason, aid projects must be carefully scrutinized to the end that aid funds should produce the maximum benefits. The choice must be for impact projects, or projects of special leverage, to borrow from the words of the late Dag Hammarskjld; that is, projects that will build up productive capacities, generate a chain reaction of productive activities and build up the strength of the economy for self-sustaining growth.

We believe that it is wise and proper for the developed countries to help more substantially in the acceleration of the economic development of the new and less fortunate countries. We should like to stress, however, the concomitant obligation of the recipient countries to provide the essential measure of self-help, to administer the aid given with integrity, and to use it for the benefit of the masses of the people who need it most. International assistance for economic development is a two-way street. The aim should be not merely to prop up governments in developing countries, but, more important still, to enrich the lives of their citizens in ways that would enhance freedom and human dignity.

The achievements of the United Nations in the economic and social fields are important in themselves, but to our mind they also serve a higher purpose. They contribute in a very real sense to the attainment of international security. They serve to defuse, as it were, some of the explosion points of the cold war. As developing countries gain more ground towards stability and prosperity, the arena of the cold war recedes. Contented and progressive societies are the best and strongest bulwarks of peace.

This is perhaps the most valuable service that the United Nations can performto help build up stout bulwarks of peace throughout the world in the form of independent and prosperous societies, to keep open the avenues of negotiation, conciliation and peaceful settlement in international disputes and to prevent the ultimate catastrophe of war from cancelling all the constructive gains so far achieved by the world community.

To accomplish this objective, the United Nations needs timewhich is the greatest gift that the nuclear Powers, who hold in their hands the choice between peace and war, can give to the Organizationtime to find fair and reasonable settlements for explosive questions like that of Berlin; time for the evolving rule of law to become more firmly established; time for humanity's desire for freedom and security to take its course towards fulfilment, until the Charter's aim of banishing the scourge of war from the face of the earth and assuring a better life for all men shall have been realized."	1962-09-27
Salvador P. Lopez	UNGA 18	"Mr. President, although the Vice-Chairman of the Philippine delegation has already taken the floor to convey to you our congratulations on your election, you will permit me to add on this occasion the expression of my warm personal felicitations.


The eighteenth session of the General Assembly has so far been relatively quiet and even dull. As one who has attended fifteen sessions of the General Assembly since 1946, I can recall many far more exciting than this. Gone are the thumping of desks and the breaking of gavels, the angry words of challenge and the mutual threats of nuclear doom. Representatives seem to have grown tame, as though realizing at last that keeping the peace is much less a matter of winning debating points than of reaching, slow step by slow step, agreements in which humanity is the only winner.


We do not, therefore, miss the excitement of previous sessions. A quiet session this may be, but hardly an uneventful one. It is as if the United Nations, upon coming of age in the eighteenth year of its life, has decided to forswear the meaningless and often dangerous diversions of its youth. Having lost its taste for fireworks and the circus, it is now ready to come to grips with the serious business at hand before it is too late namely, the survival of the human race and the improvement of the human condition. In pursuing this twofold task, it has wisely chosen an attitude of calm but steadfast dedication.


The recent conclusion of the partial nuclear test ban treaty encourages in us a sense of sobriety and a feeling of cautious optimism. By itself, the treaty means a sharp decrease in the deadly menace of atmospheric pollution, a check on the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and a slow-down in the feverish race to improve them. More important, however, this treaty has already shown its potentiality for starting a chain reaction leading to an ascending series of agreements. On 3 October 1963, barely two months after the initialling of the partial test ban agreement in Moscow, the Foreign Ministers of the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland announced that they had agreed in principle to ban nuclear weapons from space vehicles in orbit.


The Moscow Treaty is not a disarmament measure, but the new agreement to denuclearize artificial satellites in space, taken together with the two-year-old agreement to ban armaments from Antarctica, shows that there exists among the great Powers a readiness to move into the field of actual disarmament under adequate safeguards. We look to the Eighteen-Nation Committee on Disarmament to capitalize on this receptive mood among the nuclear Powers and serve as an honest broker in negotiating further agreements in this field.


We have heard of war by ""escalation. Let us hope that the Moscow Treaty represents the first step towards peace by ""escalation.


This leads us to consider next the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations. In the Congo, in West Irian, in Yemen, as earlier in Korea, Palestine and Suez, the United Nations has been able to undertake important responsibilities to curb aggression, prevent violence and maintain the peace. The Philippines contributed forces to the United Nations actions in Korea and in the Congo, and we provided civilian personnel to assist the United Nations Temporary Executive Authority in West Irian. We are prepared to pay our share of the costs of such operations to the extent of our financial ability and we have subscribed to the United Nations bond issue. We hope that equitable arrangements on a permanent basis will be worked out to ensure the success of current as well as future peace-keeping operations of the Organization.


Nobody wants to see an increase in United Nations responsibilities in this field. But in a period of nuclear stalemate, war ceases to be a safe instrument of historical change or for settling disputes or achieving national objectives. Only revolution remains in its several guises and variations. Whether we like it or not, the United Nations will increasingly be called upon to assume certain responsibilities in keeping such conflicts and upheavals under adequate control so that they do not spread or get out of hand and involve the great Powers. Realism requires that the United Nations be ready and equipped to perform these tasks.


It is fitting that we should pay a tribute to the decisive leadership exercised by the Secretary-General in this domain and we pledge to him our continuing support to the end that the United Nations may develop the requisite authority and capacity to cope with this responsibility.


The rapid pace of decolonization in recent years is a matter of deep gratification to us. Eighteen years ago, fully one third of the population of the world were subject peoples. Today, more than forty dependent countries have gained their independence. However, the struggle is far from completely won. Neo-colonialism and communist imperialism are still trying to subvert the freedom of peoples. At the same time, we are witnessing bitter rear-guard actions designed to delay the liberation of the remaining colonial peoples.


The question of the Portuguese territories is of great concern to the Assembly, for unless immediate practical steps are taken the situation in these territories, particularly Angola, may explode into open warfare with ugly racial overtones. We plead with Portugal not to misread the writing on the wall and to recognize before it is too late that its own interests, as well as the interests of peace, would be best served by quickly coming to terms with the aspirations of the people of the territories.


The same warning applies with equal force to the Government of South Africa. We have repeatedly condemned the practice of apartheid. South Africa is not the only country in the world where racial discrimination exists, but it is the only country in the world that enforces and defends racial discrimination as the policy of the state. This is intolerable in any State subscribing to the Charter of the United Nations. We have, therefore, given vigorous support to measures designed to exert international diplomatic and economic pressure on the Government of South Africa to abandon its policy of apartheid. The Philippine Government has imposed a total embargo on goods from South Africa.

As regards South West Africa, we share the view that unless South Africa agrees to discharge its obligations in that territory in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, our only alternative is to revoke its mandate and transfer the administration of the territory to the United Nations. My delegation would support such a move.

Having dealt with some issues of universal interest, we would like to pass on to the serious problems of our part of the worldSouth-East Asia.

The people of the Republic of Viet-Nam are at present engaged in a valiant fight against communist subversion and aggression. They merit the support of the free world. In the discharge of their treaty responsibilities, some members of the South-East Asia Treaty Organization are rendering material assistance to the Government of Viet-Nam.

It is a matter for regret, however, that the capacity of the Viet-Namese people to wage war against their enemies is being compromised by an internal problem which vitally concerns their freedom and national survival. The problem of Buddhism in the Republic of Viet-Nam deserves to be considered separately, by itself, outside the context of the East-West conflict.

The Philippines believes that the violation of human rights is a matter of international concern and does not fall within the exclusive domestic jurisdiction clause [Article 2, para. 7] of the Charter of the United Nations. Such violation becomes more serious when it is the result of governmental policy or action. We believe further that freedom of religion can be assured under any system, whether there is a State religion or complete separation of Church and State.

We find it gratifying that the Government of the Republic of Viet-Nam lifted martial law some time ago and has now extended, through the President of the General Assembly and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, an invitation to some Members of this Assembly to visit Viet-Nam and see for themselves the true situation regarding the relations between the Government and the Buddhist community. It is rare for a Member State of the United Nationsand rarer still for a non-member Stateto admit, let alone invite, United Nations observers or investigators within its borders. This is an earnest of the good faith of the Viet-Namese Government and proof that it has nothing to hide. We should therefore accept the invitation at once and, in fairness, decide to suspend consideration of the agenda item pending receipt of the report of our observers.

As regards Laos, it will be recalled that fourteen countries assumed special responsibilities for its independence, unity, and neutrality in the Geneva conferences of 1954 and 1962. However, this unprecedented action cannot be said to have relieved the United Nationswhich transcends the personality of the fourteen Statesof its duty to deal with any matter affecting international peace and security. We can readily understand why the Prime Minister of Laos reported the other day [1210th meeting] to this august body on the precarious situation obtaining in his country. He felt obliged to do so because his country is a Member of the United Nations, although he observed that its problems arose from agreements made outside the framework of the United Nations.

While the Charter encourages regional solutions to regional problems, the United Nations is not thereby absolved from its duty under the Charter to intervene or to use its good offices in the interest of peace. Moreover, the Geneva accords are not strictly regional in character. This is because the initiative was taken by the great Powers which have world-wide responsibilities for the maintenance of peace. Not all the countries of South-East Asia were represented at the Geneva Conference. On the other hand, nations from other continents which have no particular interests in South-East Asia participated in the meetings.

It should also be noted that the Geneva Agreement of 1962 virtually excluded Laos from the purview of the South-East Asia Treaty Organization, which has assumed certain responsibilities for the peace of the Treaty area. My delegation accordingly considers that the United Nations may deal with the problem of Laos either on its own initiative or at the request of a Member State.

The Prime Minister of Laos informed us here that there has been no progress whatsoever towards the unity of his country as envisaged in the 1962 Agreement, so much so that its very independence as guaranteed in the 1954 Agreement has been jeopardized. He ascribed this sad state of affairs to continued infiltration and subversion by foreign elements. The International Control Commission has proved to be ineffectual because of the obstructionist policy followed by one member, while the Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conferences have not been able to accomplish anything beyond addressing a pious appeal to all concerned to observe the letter and spirit of the Geneva agreements.

It may be that a change in its composition or the elimination of the built-in veto will render the International Control Commission more effective. It may also be that there is a fundamental defect in the coalition government called for by the Geneva Agreement of 1962. It should be noted that coalition is synonymous neither with unity nor neutrality. The Philippines has never believed that the ""troika"" system would work so long as one of the parties continues to receive orders from a foreign government or so long as its avowed aim is to subvert the established government by illegal means. That is why the Philippines chose to have nothing to do at all with the Geneva conferences or with the agreements reached therein. Nevertheless, we would like to see an improvement in the Laotian situation, if only as a result of the relaxation of tensions engendered by the recent partial nuclear test ban treaty.

The Powers which signed the Geneva Agreement of 1962 should consider making a fresh effort to implement their decisions. Failing that, they should consider submitting the problem, the solution of which has eluded them for the past nine years, to the ultimate judgment of the United Nations. Laos is a Member of the United Nations and as such entitled to the full assistance and protection of the Organization.

In justice to the Powers which signed the Geneva Agreement of 1962, however, we should give them credit for the great service they have rendered the Laotian people in preventing the dismemberment of their country. As a result, Laos has so far escaped the fate of the divided States which have been denied admission to our Organization.

We should also like to note with satisfaction the report that two next-door neighbours in our region, Thailand and Cambodia, are hopeful of reaching agreement on a solution to their dispute and on the terms for the restoration of their friendly relations. The credit goes not only to the leaders of the two countries concerned but also to the Secretary-General and his representatives on the spot, whose patient diplomacy is helping to bring about a reconciliation.

South-East Asia, with its 250 million people, its bulging rice granary, its abundant production of copra, sugar, rubber, oil, tin and other minerals, lumber, tobacco and spices, is one of the richest and most strategic regions of the world. For centuries it has been the valuable prize coveted, fought over and exploited by the major Western colonial Powers. Most of the latter have now departed. But to the north of this region lies Communist China which, through its southern borders that run from the Himalayas to the China Sea, has the capacity to infiltrate, subvert and attack its neighbours. It committed open aggression against India, which over the years had loyally cultivated its friendship. It is responsible for subversion and guerrilla warfare in Laos and the Republic of Viet-Nam. Because of its ruthless pursuit of power, its contempt for the principle of peaceful coexistence, and its declared readiness to risk nuclear catastrophe for ideological reasons, Communist China has become the world's principal source and inspirer of the fear of war. But for the countries of South-East Asia in particular, Communist China is the principal goad pushing them towards mutual help, co-operation and unity.

At this point, I trust I may be permitted to report with pardonable pride that Manila during the past year has served as a busy centre of regional diplomatic activity. The conferences held in the capital city of my country included the nineteenth session of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East which devoted a great deal of attention to the problem of promoting economic development and improving living conditions in the region. The familiar slogan of ""trade, not aid"" acquired new significance as the members of ECAFE wrestled once again with the well-known contrast between the low, unstable prices of raw materials and the ever-increasing prices of consumer and capital goods from the industrial countries. It was clearly shown that the entire amount of technical and financial assistance which the developed countries had given to the under-developed and developing countries in any given year was, in fact, less than the loss suffered by the latter due to the depressed prices of their export products and the steadily higher prices they had to pay for their imports from the industrial countries. This stern statistical fact seemed to make a mockery of the entire system of foreign economic aid and exposed it as a tissue of noble intentions nullified by the realities of trade and profit. There was talk in Manila of an Asian common market, but we know that at this stage such talk is little better than whistling in the dark. The night is too full of the established ghosts of economic and financial power, and we need the benign spirit of the United Nations to exorcise them from the economic world of the under-developed and developing countries.

We also celebrated in Manila the second anniversary of the Association of South-East Asia, organized by Thailand, Malaya, and the Philippines to promote closer economic, social, and cultural co-operation among them.

But the principal diplomatic event of the year in Manila was without doubt the holding there from 30 July to 5 August of the summit meeting between Tunku Abdul Rahman, Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya, President Diosdado Macapagal of the Philippines, and President Sukarno of Indonesia. On the initiative of the President of the Philippines, they met to resolve their differences about the formation of the new Federation of Malaysia. At the end of their meeting, they adopted the Manila Accord of 31 July 1963, which was the report of their Foreign Ministers; a Joint Statement, which set forth the details of the settlement of their dispute over Malaysia; and the Manila Declaration, in which they agreed to establish a consultative organization known as MaphilindoMalaya, the Philippines, and Indonesia. This last achievement, which was hailed around the world, was described by President Macapagal as the reunion of triplet brothers who at birth had been placed under three foster parentsIndonesia under the Netherlands, the Philippines under Spain and the United States of America, and Malaya under the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Irelandbut who, having come of age, now need to discover anew their common origin and destiny. In effect, these three countries have a common Malay origin and number together 140 millions.

This was the atmosphere in which the achievements of the Manila summit meeting were received amidst euphoria. The three Malay Heads of Government had agreed to resolve their differences over Malaysia. One understanding was that Malaysia would be proclaimed around the end of September. Another was that the sending of observers would be an integral part of the ascertainment operation. Indonesia was prepared to welcome Malaysia provided it was purged of its neo-colonialist taint, and the Philippines agreed to welcome it on condition that the inclusion of the territory of Sabah or North Borneo in the new Federation would not prejudice our claim to that territory or any right thereunder. Both Indonesia and the Philippines were prepared to accept Malaysia and thus subordinate their doubts and misgivings, provided the support of the people of the Borneo territories was ascertained by an independent and impartial authority, the Secretary-General of the United Nations or his representativeto quote the words of paragraph 10 of the Manila Accord.

At our request, the Secretary-General was good enough to accept the task of ascertainment. He sent a mission of nine members to the two territories of Sarawak and Sabah; the mission submitted its report to him, and on 14 September 1963 he made public his conclusions on the basis of that report. He announced that his team had found a majority of the inhabitants of the two territories in favour of federation with Malaya. Two days later, on 16 September, Malaysia was proclaimed. That was the day before the opening of the present session of the General Assembly.

The Philippines and Indonesia had certain reservations about the findings of the United Nations Malaysia Mission, which they respectfully communicated to the Secretary-General. As of today, they have not welcomed or recognized Malaysia.

Before explaining our position, I wish to reiterate emphatically our confidence in the integrity of the Secretary-General, in his good faith and sincere intention to comply with the letter and spirit of the agreement reached in Manila. The ascertainment operation fell short of its goal because of circumstances beyond his control. The facts indicate that the main responsibility for the failure of the United Nations survey teams to fulfil the terms of the Secretary-General's mandate rests with the United Kingdom authorities.

The terms of the ascertainment operation represented a carefully balanced structure of understandings and compromises among the Maphilindo countries. There were three important conditions: first, that the task should be carried out with a fresh approach, meaning that the ascertainment should not rely on previous British procedures and findings; second, that there should be complete compliance with the principle of self-determination in accordance with the requirements of principle IX of the annex to General Assembly resolution 1541 (XV), meaning that the ascertainment operation should be a genuine and thorough effort rather than a pro forma job; and, third, that observers representing the three countries should witness the ascertainment.

The Philippine Government went to great lengths to forestall any possible misunderstanding of these conditions, and to help facilitate the Secretary-General's task. Immediately after the meeting in Manila, we dispatched a special envoy to United Nations Headquarters to explain not only the agreements themselves but also their background, the compromises they represented and the understandings under which they were acceptedunderstandings which, though they were not in writing, were equally binding on the three countries in the Asian spirit of mushawara

One such unwritten understanding was that the ascertainment would take at least a month and that Malaysia would be proclaimed about the end of September. Another was that the sending of observers would be an integral part of the ascertainment operation. 

Thus we sought to obviate the possibility of an unintentional misreading of the terms of the ascertainment. Nevertheless, its three essential conditions were not fully complied with. For instance, the time-table of the operation, which had been envisaged to cover four to six weeks, was drastically reduced to ten working days. This, in turn, rendered impossible not only the ""complete compliance"" but also the ""fresh approach"" called for under paragraph 4 of the Joint Statement. Obliged to operate within these crippling restrictions, the United Nations working teams had to rely heavily on the previous United Kingdom procedures and findings. They had no choice. They were under heavy pressure of time, and they could hardly be blamed for doing so. This was, however, contrary to the intent of the Manila Accord. The report of our own observers, carefully prepared and documented, clearly shows the extent of that reliance.

The unreasonable obstructions to the complete witnessing of the ascertainment operation was also a clear violation of the Manila Accord. The fact that the Philippine and Indonesian observers were able to witness only the last three days of the operation was a substantive and unjustified modification of that agreement. The irony of the situation is manifest in the fact that the first two thirds of the ascertainment operation was witnessed exclusively by representatives of the United Kingdom and Federation of Malaya, the two countries already committed to the incorporation of the two territories into Malaysia.

The squabbling and quibbling about our observers were beyond belief. For two weeks we haggled with the United Kingdom authorities about the number, the rank and the mode of transport of our observers. First, they agreed to two observers, then to four observers, then to four additional assistants, and, to cap it all, they wanted to dictate how junior the assistants should be. Finally, the United Kingdom, which, as an ally of my country, may fly its military aircraft into Philippine air bases at any time on request, refused landing rights to the one aircraft which was to bring our observers to Borneo.

The crowning gesture, however, of disregard for the Manila Agreement was the United Kingdom announcement, in the very midst of the ascertainment operation, that the new Federation of Malaysia would be proclaimed on 16 September, irrespective of the outcome of the ascertainment; I repeat, irrespective of the outcome of the ascertainment. This announcement was plainly contrary to the Manila Accord which provided that the wishes of the people of Sarawak and Sabah should be ascertained prior to the establishment of the new Federation. The Secretary-General was so disturbed by this announcement that he later described it ""as a slap on the United Nations"".

In his statement here of 27 September [1219th meeting], Lord Home, the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, challenged Mr. Palar, the representative of Indonesia, either to say that he impugns the integrity of the Secretary-General and his teams or to ""keep quiet and accept the findings with good grace"".

Is anybody who deliberately obstructed the task of ascertainment, including the participation of our observers, and who himself showed such scant regard for the Secretary-General, entitled to stand here as the defender of the integrity of the Secretary-General? Does anyone who had publicly announced that he would disregard the findings of the United Nations teams have the right to accuse somebody else of ignoring those findings?

The Government of the Philippines could not set aside the findings of its own observers or close its eyes to the failure of the United Nations teams to implement faithfully the terms of the Manila Agreement. The Secretary-General was obliged to draw his conclusions on the basis of the findings put before him by his survey teams. We do not challenge his conclusions. But we do take exception to the manner in which the survey was conducted and the report prepared. This was a case where the conduct of the survey was perhaps even more important than the outcome of the survey itself. It was important that the ascertainment should not only be honest but should appear to be honest.

As regards the report of the United Nations Malaysia Mission, the internal evidence shows that it was prepared with undue haste, with considerably less than the care and objectivity which one expects of a United Nations document. I have accordingly registered with the Secretary-General our reservations in respect of the report. We have, however, deliberately refrained from taking any further steps in regard to this matter out of our deep regard for the Secretary-General's position and the difficulties under which he himself acknowledges he had to discharge his mandate. He is satisfied that we understand his position, and we appreciate his understanding of ours. He is aware that we do not question his judgement by deciding to hold the recognition of the new State of Malaysia under advisement, for this is merely our way of saying, in effect, that we are less than satisfied with the way in which the ascertainment was carried out and the report prepared.

In referring to Malaysia, I have used the term ""new State"" advisedly. It was so conceived by its founders. It was envisaged as such by the Commission of Enquiry, North Borneo and Sarawak, 1962the Cobbold Commissionwhich recommended its establishment in these words:

""We have examined the Federation of Malaya Constitution and have concluded that it could be taken as a basis for the purpose of the creation of Malaysia. With the necessary amendments to the Constitution, we envisage the entry of the two Borneo territories as States within the Federation. With their admission, the Federation of Malaya would cease to exist as a political entity, and would be succeeded by the Federation of Malaysia.""

For the Philippines, the question is not merely one of nomenclature or legal nicety. Vital national interests are involved, chief among these being our pending claim to Sabah or North Borneo, one of the territories which have been incorporated in the new State of Malaysia.

I shall not burden the record with a discussion of the legal basis and historical background of our claim. Our statement at the seventeenth regular session is adequate for this purpose. I only wish to point out that paragraph 12 of the Manila Accord states:

""The Philippines made it clear that its position on the inclusion of North Borneo in the Federation of Malaysia is subject to the final outcome of the Philippine claim to North Borneo, and that the inclusion of North Borneo in the Federation of Malaysia would not prejudice either the claim or any right thereunder

The Philippine Government does not consider as adequate a simple statement that the new State of Malaysia accepts the commitments of the former Federation of Malaya under the agreement reached at Manila. What is required is a formal, explicit undertaking by the new State of Malaysia to co-operate in the peaceful settlement of the Philippine claim to North Borneo. It requires, further, that a mutually acceptable procedure for settlement be agreed upon.

It should be recalled that Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman signed the Manila Accord on behalf of the Federation of Malaya, a State which did not include North Borneo, and was therefore not directly involved in the dispute. Indeed, the commitment assumed by the Federation of Malaya consisted of a simple pledge to join Indonesia and the Philippines in requesting the United Kingdom Government to agree to seek a just and expeditious solution to the dispute. A statement, therefore, that the new Federation of Malaysia accepts the obligations of the former Federation of Malaya under the Manila Accord would result in an equivocation. The fact is that the new State of Malaysia has now, so far as control over North Borneo is concerned, succeeded to the United Kingdom Government. It is in this new capacity as successor to the United Kingdom Government in North Borneo that the new Federation of Malaysia has been requested by our Government to agree to a definite procedure for the settlement of our claim.

The United Kingdom Government, despite the fact that it considered our claim to be weak, nevertheless ignored our repeated requests to agree to any of the modes of pacific settlement mentioned in the Charter, and in particular to accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice over the case. We hope that Malaysia will accept more readily than the United Kingdom our repeated appeals to the rule of law.

The record of the United Kingdom in the domain of decolonization is admirable in many ways. Among the great colonial Powers, it has acted sensibly and with deliberate speed to set its numerous dependent territories on the road to freedom. In the particular case of Malaysia, it is only fair to underline the fact that the United Kingdom, which had never before permitted United Nations personnel to enter and survey conditions in any of its Non-Self-Governing Territories, did agree to admit a United Nations survey mission in Sarawak and Sabah. But, having taken this unprecedented decision, the United Kingdom authorities either tried to nullify it or render it meaningless in the manner already described. It is a matter for regret that so hopeful a precedent was not permitted to develop fully and in good faith. The ridiculous dispute about our observers would seem to justify the suspicion that a trap had been deliberately set for Indonesia and the Philippines so that they would be compelled to question the findings of the United Nations teams and thus put our two countries at odds with the United Nations as well as with Malaysia.

This would be impossible to believe were it not that this is merely an example of the old imperialist tactic of ""divide and rule."" No colonial Power has ever of its free will and volition relinquished dominion Over another country or people. When it does withdraw, under heavy threat or pressure, it tries to minimize the loss and to retain in some measure, under camouflage, its former power and influence. In certain cases, it plants booby-traps of suspicion, dissension and conflict among those it leaves behind. A perceptive commentary in this connexion is to be found in an editorial article entitled ""Malaysia"", in the issue of 19 September 1963 of the newspaper of Karachi, Pakistan.

I quote:


""It is one of the lessons of post-war history that imperialism invariably leaves behind a legacy of strife and trouble in the lands it has controlled and misruled. Few in this country""that is, Pakistan""can ever forget that the British made a parting gift of the Kashmir problem to th"	1963-10-08
Mauro Mendez	UNGA 19	"Mr. President, will you allow me, first of all, to convey to you the warm felicitations of the Philippine delegation on your election as President of the nineteenth session of the General Assembly. Your election by unanimous acclamation was not only an exceptional tribute paid to you personally and to the country you so ably represent, but also a dramatic recognition of the significant role which Africa has assumed in the affairs of mankind and in the future of this Organization.

One could well believe that the logic of events, rather than mere coincidence, has placed upon the shoulders of an African President of the General Assembly a major share of the responsibility for steering the United Nations safely through a dangerous crisis arising from recent developments and decisions relating mainly to Africa. The concurrence of these two facts encourages the hope that a permanent solution to the crisis shall be devisedconsistent with the Charter and acceptable to the General Assembly.

Unless and until a solution to this crisis is found, we are condemned to do our work in an atmosphere of unreality. The extraordinary procedure which permitted us to open and proceed with the present session we owe entirely to the prudence of the Secretary-General and to the goodwill of the parties principally involved.

But this is a temporary palliative which merely enables us to buy the time we need in order to discover a permanent remedy. What confronts us is not merely a financial crisis which can be resolved by the payment of certain sums of roubles and francs, but a constitutional crisis which compels us to decide whether we want the United Nations to continue to existand, if so, what we want it to be or to become, to do or to be capable of doing.

On many previous occasions, under one agenda item or another, we have debated and endeavoured to define more precisely the purposes and principles of the United Nations as enunciated in Chapter I of the Charter. No portion of the Charter has been more frequently invoked than this, and the attempts to analyse its scope and meaning fill many volumes of our records. Today, however, the question of what the United Nations is and what we want it to do is presented to us not as a subject of philosophical or juridical exegesis, but as an issue directly related to the power of the purse. That is why it has assumed the nature of an acute problem which cannot be side-stepped indefinitely. That is why any attempt to gloss over the dispute that has arisen or to remain silent while negotiations are in progress would constitute a grave disservice to the Organization.

While we have no desire to disturb such negotiations, it would be a mistake to act as if the controversy concerned only two or three Member States, however important or powerful, and to accept the view that it is their exclusive responsibility to negotiate an agreed solution. Even if we agree to refrain from voting, we are at least entitled to express our views or to make our wishes known. After all, this is what votum means in the original Latin. We have a right and a duty to say that we want the United Nations to survive, and to indicate under what terms such survival may best be ensured. The Great Powers directly concerned, far from disdaining our views and suggestions, should welcome them as a guide in measuring their own aims and policies, and in determining in what direction we may safely move in order to extricate ourselves from this impasse.

There is no question that an important decision must be taken during the present session concerning the procedure that is to govern the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations. Such a decision would, first of all, place on a new, more clear-cut basis the division of responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security between the Security Council and the General Assembly. It would set forth without ambiguity the precise relationship between the authority to ordain or to carry out peace-keeping operations and the responsibility to raise the funds required by such operations. It would take account of such questions as the financial assessments that would be appropriate to the author, or to the victim of an act of aggression which calls for a peace-keeping effort by the United Nations.

Such an over-all decision concerning the organization, conduct, and financing of United Nations peace-keeping operations is long overdue. It would put an end to the makeshift procedure which has been followed until now on a strictly ad hoc basis. Such a decision would of necessity look to the future; it would apply automatically to all future peace-keeping operations of the United Nations. But it would provide so useful a framework for all United Nations activities in the domain of peace-keeping that it would be immediately accepted as the most imaginative and practical instrument of a constitutional character since the Charter was proclaimed in San Francisco. And every detail and aspect of this framework would have been examined with such great care and so thoroughly discussed and debated that its approval by the General Assembly and acceptance by the Security Council would inevitably influence our attitudes towards the peace-keeping operations undertaken by the United Nations in the past. A decision covering future operations would cast its shadow backward, and its principles would be inevitably invoked to resolve subsisting controversies.

It is to the formulation of such an over-all decision concerning future peace-keeping operations that the present disputants might more usefully address their efforts. This Assembly would certainly be prepared to buckle down immediately to this important task. Meanwhile, however, the question of the application of Article 19 of the Charter must be faced. There is no way to avoid it. Given the text of the Article and given the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice, which was sought by the General Assembly itself, there is no escape from the obligation to apply the Charter provision. Failure to apply it to powerful States today, and its application to less powerful States tomorrow, would be intolerable from the point of view of the latter. The result would be anarchy.

The attempt to blur the clear outlines of the dispute by calling the payments by some other name is no doubt well-intentioned, and one could wish that it might be accepted. But failing such a remedy, we are obliged to fall back upon procedures sanctioned by the rule of law, by reason, and by common sense.

For the present, the Charter is the law, and if we ignore Article 19 and decide that it does not apply to the arrears on assessments for certain peace-keeping operations, we immediately invite the collapse of responsibility and order within the Organization. This will come about in various ways: through the threat of financial bankruptcy, disregard of the obligations of membership, deterioration of individual and collective discipline, and attrition of the United Nations capacity to maintain international peace and security. 

We cannot disregard Article 19, and we do not agree with those who fear that the procedure laid down by the Article would bring about the destruction of the United Nations. This dire prediction is based on the belief that the Members whose position is not sustained by the General Assembly would immediately resign from the Organization. We need not point out to the Members concerned that we all need the United Nations, and that the United Nations needs all of us.

Members have walked out from meetings and boycotted portions of a session, but in the one case where the membership of a certain State has been under serious question, there has been far more talk of its expulsion than of its resignation.

What we might more likely expect from a clear-cut determination of the present controversy is not the wreckage of the United Nations as such, but the emergence of the kind of United Nations that we honestly need and want, for which we are prepared to sacrifice and to pay. We shall be compelled to indicate more precisely what we want the United Nations to be and to do, and, having done that, to pay our share of the expenses without fail. This can only be a gain, not a loss.

Three of the Great Powers, permanent members of the Security Council, are known to be directly involved in the controversy. It would take all three of them, together by deliberate decision, to wreck the United Nations. Each of them, singly, cannot and probably dares not do it. At the same time, the United Nations is saved the moment any one of them decides not to join the others in the deliberate act of wreckage and destruction. We do not believe that such a conspiracy exists, whether by accident or design.

If these three Great Powers should decide to come to the General Assembly for judgment, what would we do? We hope that we shall not be compelled to emulate the wisdom of King Solomon, who succeeded in determining who was the true mother of the disputed child by threatening to cut it in twain. During the war, these three Great Powers gave equally of the lives of their sons and the sacrifices of their peoples in order to make the United Nations a living reality. Now that the United Nations is just beginning to yield returns upon the original investment, in terms of the expanding freedom of peoples and the strengthened peace of the world, it is inconceivable that these same Powers should risk dismantling the Organization or want to destroy it. This would be unnatural.

Mr. President, we have dealt at some length with a question which is uppermost in our minds but which, for some curious reason, has been muted during this general debate. The result is an atmosphere of make-believe, as if everybody is aware that we are just killing time, and that nothing can be said or done meanwhile that really matters. It is a depressing experience. We have elected our President, but there is no General Committee. We are having a general debate, but we do not have an agenda. The regular Committees have not been organized. We run the risk of not electing the new members of the three Councils, thus inhibiting them from functioning by 1 January 1965. We run the risk also of having no budget approved before the end of 1964. 

We stoutly reject the notion that this Assembly of 115 delegations has neither the wit nor tlle courage to surmount this controversy, which if allowed to persist without solution, is bound to earn for us the pity, if not the contempt, of the world.

We would have preferred, Mr. President, to have spoken of the achievements and failures of the past and of our plans for the future. For there are many things to which we can point with pride in the record of the past twelve months. In the politico-military field, there is the partial test-ban treaty; the hot line link between Washington and Moscow; the cutback in the production of fissionable materials by the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and the United States; the reduction in military expenditures by the United States and the Soviet Union; and the modest progress achieved in international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer spaceall these sufficiently massive in their total impact for peace so as to outweigh the ominous portent of the atomic explosion by Communist China.


We would like to underscore our hope that the Eighteen-Nation Committee on Disarmament will continue exploring every avenue that could lead to a significant breakthrough in this most crucial of questions ever to confront the United Nations.

We also reaffirm our unalterable opposition to any move to give the seat of China in the United Nations to the Communist rgime in Peking as an act that would reward aggression and encourage that rgime's unabashed belief in the inevitability of war and its unashamed policy of force in achieving its objectives. As regards the question of Korea, the Philippines continues to support the stated objectives of the United Nations and favours the continued existence of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea in pursuance of those objectives.

By the same token, the Philippines would like to express its sympathy for the peoples of two other divided nations, Germany and Viet-Nam. We hope that the German people will soon be permitted to achieve their unification in accordance with the principle of self-determination through the freely-expressed will of the people. We pray that free Berlin will continue to stand as a symbol of the determination of the liberty-loving people of Germany to resist Communist regimentation and tyranny.

As regards Viet-Nam, the Philippines is committed to a policy of assisting, within its means and on request, the Republic of Viet-Nam in its efforts to defend itself against Communist encroachment and infiltration from the north.

In the same spirit, the Philippines has sponsored with El Salvador and Nicaragua [A/5765] the reinclusion in our agenda of the item The question of Tibet, under which the General Assembly would call for respect of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the people of Tibet in accordance with its resolution 1723 (XVI).

It will be noted that most of these questions are directly related to the policies or actions of Communist China. It might have seemed more prudent to keep a discreet silence about the misdeeds of Communist China following its recent explosion of an atomic device, particularly where these concern socalled lost or desperate causes. But the Philippines believes that there are no lost causes where freedom and justice are concerned, and that it is particularly cowardly to sweep these old questions under the carpet in the face of a condemned aggressor grown more arrogant still by the possession of an atomic firecracker.

The Philippines will continue to support the work of the Special Committee until the Declaration on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples is fully implemented and the last subject people is free. We shall co-operate in carrying out any practical measures to combat the discredited and disastrous policy of apartheid of the Government of South Africa.

We regard the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, which convened in Geneva earlier in 1964, as a major step toward the realization of the goal of the United Nations Development Decade. While it may have fallen short of the expectations of most developing countries, the Conference did advance their cause by achieving explicit recognition of the urgent need to reform the existing structure of international trade in favour of the less developed countries. It was at this Conference that the developing countries, uniting in the Group of 75, found a new and vigorous voice to express their anxieties and their needs. Having played an important part in forging the agreements concluded at Geneva, the Philippines expresses the hope that the Group of 75 will continue to be a positive force in working for equitable change in the world economic order.

The Philippines has maintained its special interest in human rights. We have done so because we sincerely believe that respect for the worth and dignity of the individual is the foundation of all social well-being and that social progress is the necessary concomitant of economic advancement. It has been said that developing countries need to give precedence to economic programmes at the cost of subordinating social necessities. Fortunately, the Philippines has not accepted this artificial and harmful dichotomy. We believe that a free and enlightened citizenry is the surest guarantee of political stability and material development. The Philippines will give its particular attention to the adoption of measures of implementation of the two Covenants on Human Rights. We hope that, after a long delay, effective measures to protect and guarantee human rights will finally become an integral part of these legally binding instruments; for, without effective measures of implementation, the rights set forth in these Covenants will remain meaningless and, at best, theoretical. Tomorrow, 10 December, we celebrate the sixteenth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the passage of so much time since 1948 eloquently dramatizes the work which awaits to be done with the least possible delay.

It only remains for us to refer briefly to the role of the Philippines in the effort to achieve a peaceful settlement of the conflict between our neighbours, Indonesia and Malaysia. The background of this conflict was laid before the General Assembly at its eighteenth session. In June 1964, President Macapagal was able to persuade President Sukarno and Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman to hold a summit meeting in Tokyo. The meeting, made possible with the cooperation of the Governments of Thailand and Japan, considered President Macapagals proposal for the establishment of an Afro-Asian conciliation commission which would make recommendations for the peaceful settlement of the dispute and the restoration of normal relations among the parties.


President Sukarno accepted the Macapagal proposal without reservation and pledged in advance to accept the recommendations of the conciliation commission. Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman, on the other hand, accepted the proposal in principle, on condition that Indonesian troops be first withdrawn from Malaysian territory. Unhappily, the Philippines failed in subsequent attempts to bring the parties back to the conference table in order to reach final agreement on the terms of the Macapagal conciliation proposal. When, two months later, the conflict was brought before the Security Council on a formal complaint by Malaysia, the draft resolution which, among other things, would have endorsed the Macapagal proposal was blocked by the negative vote of the Soviet Union. The conciliation proposal itself was, however, commended by all members of the Council.


This fact encourages us to hope that at an appropriate occasion, possibly some time during the present session, the representatives of Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia may have an opportunity to meet informally here in New York to explore the possibility of bringing the confrontation policy to an end and restoring normal relations between the three countries. So far as the Philippines is concerned, we are prepared to normalize our relations with Malaysia as soon as it agrees to the settlement of our claim to North Borneo by the International Court of Justice. We hope that Malaysia will eventually welcome this proposal, which demonstrates our readiness to accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court and to abide by the rule of law in international relations.


By mediating and conciliating the dispute between Indonesia and Malaysia, and by scrupulously adhering to the rule of law in its own attitude towards Malaysia, the Philippines hopes to make its modest contribution to the peace and security of our troubled area.

Mr. President, following the example of previous speakers, we would have preferred to have concentrated exclusively on a more detailed summary of the past and future work of the United Nations in various fields. Yet an exclusive concern with these staple problems before the United Nations, in blind disregard of the crisis that threatens the United Nations itself, would have deepened the sense of unreality and the atmosphere of make-believe which have permeated our meetings since 1 December.

We must break this illusion which, by a combination of procedural tricks and stage management, gives us the eerie feeling of participating in a slow pantomime in an underwater tank. In truth, however, we are facing reality in two dimensions of danger: to the survival of the United Nations, and to the survival of humanity.

During this session, the General Assembly is confronted by these two tremendous challenges to its courage and wisdom. May it prove itself equal to both of them."	1964-12-09
Salvador P. Lopez	UNGA 20	"Allow me, first of all, to take this opportunity to acknowledge with gratitude the many expressions of sympathy which my delegation has received from all sides, including the Secretary-General and various delegations, following the disaster which has befallen my country as a result of the eruption of the Taal volcano. On an occasion like this, we learn once again the ancient truth that we are all neighbours huddled together on our fragil planet, and that all men are brothers in suffering and compassion.

Mr. President, may I join those who have preceded me to this rostrum in extending to you our warm felicitations on your elevation to the Presidency of the General Assembly. Your election constitutes a recognition of your eminent personal qualifications as well as a tribute to the great country you so ably and fittingly represent. We are confident that under your wise guidance the General Assembly will be able to meet the grave challenges to the peace and well-being of mankind.

The Philippine delegation enters upon the work of the twentieth session with renewed faith in our capacity to make the United Nations an increasingly effective instrument for safeguarding world peace through freedom and justice, elevating the economic, social and cultural conditions of mankind, and advancing the rule of law in international relations. This sense of reawakened hope springs mainly from three major developments which reaffirm the desire and ability of our Organization to achieve the purposes set out in the Charter.

Firstly, we are deeply gratified by the success of the Security Council in bringing about a cease-fire between India and Pakistan. Although the cease-fire is yet to become completely effective and the truce is still precarious, we must welcome this event as proof of the efficacy of the Security Council whenever it acts with undivided will and purpose, with the devoted co-operation of the Secretary-General, as intended by the Charter. Our sense of satisfaction, however, and our optimism are conditioned by an awareness that the roots of the conflict run too deep and strong to justify any hope of an easy or immediate solution. Endless tact and infinite patience will be required to achieve a lasting peace.

Secondly, we are encouraged by the restoration of the normal functioning of the General Assembly. The Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations, ably guided by the distinguished President of the nineteenth session, Mr. Alex Qualson-Sackey, has enabled us to overcome a constitutional crisis which for some time paralysed the General Assembly. Fortunately for mankind, the Assembly has regained its dynamism in time to confront the increasing backlog of tasks undone. My delegation wishes to pay tribute to those delegations which, by their prudent statesmanship, helped to make possible an understanding that enabled the General Assembly to rise from a state of frustration. The Philippine delegation believes, however, that this happy outcome should not give occasion for complacency. On the contrary, we should try immediately to reach agreement on the necessary modalities for undertaking peace-keeping operations in the future. Only thus would we be able to meet with deliberate speed any threat to the peace without provoking another constitutional crisis that could destroy the United Nations. Such an agreement should be in conformity with the letter and spirit of the Charter, upholding, in particular, the principle of collective responsibility of Member States for the maintenance of international peace.

Thirdly, the Philippine delegation is elated by the ratification of the Charter amendments providing for an increase in the membership of both the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council. Beyond proving the capacity of the United Nations for dynamic growth and change, these amendments afford the nations of Asia and Africa a more equitable representation in these two principal organs and an opportunity to make more positive contributions to the work of the Organization as a whole. They will be able to give fuller voice to the aspirations of mankind for peace and well-being, thus deepening their sense of identification with the Organization and their commitment to its principles and purposes.

My delegation is also encouraged by the fact that, despite the impasse in the General Assembly, our Organization, together with the specialized agencies, has been able to carry out without interruption many of its essential activities in the political, economic and social fields. This fact, of course, reflected the determination of our Governments and peoples that the effort to maintain international peace and security and to promote freedom and well-being should not suffer for any reason whatever. In this way, we asserted the primacy of human life and affirmed the principle that the United Nations was made for man and not man for the United Nations.

From these considerations which give us hope we turn sadly to the situation in Asia. The Asian scene is a sombre one. It is one of the ironies of history that this region, which taught the world the power of non-violence and gave to the United Nations the idea of International Co-operation Year, should now be rent from one end to the other by unresolved conflicts, armed confrontations, and open war.

The situation in Laos, though quiet for the moment, remains precarious, a potential threat to peace in the area. While Indonesia's political, economic and military confrontation of Malaysia has continued, the situation in Malaysia itself has recently been disturbed by secession and in Indonesia, only last night, by rebellion. Korea and Viet-Nam remain divided, the latter the battleground of a war whose end is not yet in sight. As we noted earlier, India and Pakistan have agreed to a cease-fire, but the fact that a tragic war between these two brother nations could happen at all shows how fragile peace has become in Asia.

And the threat is not to peace alone, but to human survival as well. For over Asia now looms the menace of further nuclear proliferation. Communist China is on the way to becoming a nuclear Power. Indonesia has announced its intention to become one. The implications of these events for the other Asian nations are extremely serious. Already there is growing pressure in India to manufacture an atomic bomb. How long will it be before the sense of insecurity, heightened by the fear that an effective system of universal disarmament may not be worked out in time, gives rise to a nuclear arms race in Asia?

The negative aspects of the Asian situation are so alarming that they tend to obscure the positive ones. What matter that a number of Asian countries are stable, prosperous, and making a success of democracy, when the general condition of the region suggests a process that could turn it into a cockpit for contending Powers? The dominant impression is of turmoil and violence: Asia is a ""sea of troubles"" which threatens to engulf all the constructive developments of the past two decades.

However, this time of trial for Asia is also a time of challenge and opportunity for all who are concerned with its condition and its destiny. For us, the newly independent Asian States, the challenge is to measure up to the responsibilities of freedom, to safeguard our independence against all forms of imperialist or colonialist domination, whether old or new, and to regard the well-being of our peoples in a free and peaceful Asia as a goal worthy of our supreme endeavour and steadfast loyalty. Asian nationalism demands a role compatible with recovered independence and dignity for the new Asian States in the vital task of ensuring their own survival. The concept of this role varies from nation to nation in Asia. On the basis of our bitter experience, we in the Philippines consider that Communist aggression and subversion have been and continue to be the chief threats to freedom and stability in Asia. So long as these threats remain, there will be a need for bilateral and regional defence arrangements with friendly non-Asian Powers, such as those which the Philippines has entered into in exercise of its rights under the Charter. To those nations which oppose such defence arrangements, we say that until the United Nations has set up a machinery for peace-keeping on a permanent basis, and until it has established the system of collective security envisaged in the Charter, we consider these bilateral and regional arrangements indispensable. At the same time, we are prepared to support proposals that would expedite the achievement of these twin United Nations goals of peace-keeping and collective security.

For their part, the non-Asian Powers which share the responsibility for the defence of the region should place their relationship with the new Asian States on a basis compatible with the aims of Asian nationalism. As President Diosdado Macapagal of the Philippines has said, this is one of the inescapable consequences of Asian independence. No viable relationship between Asian and non-Asian Powers could be built or maintained on any other basis. To respond creatively to the challenge of Asian nationalism is one of the crucial tasks confronting non-Asian Powers which have a genuine interest in the welfare of the region.

One such response could take the form of sincere support for the efforts of Asian Governments to fashion a framework of stability and peace for Asia within which its component nations could achieve progress in freedom. In President Macapagal's words: ""The crying need of this area today is a stable peace which could provide the security indispensable to the unhampered development of all the nations in the area. Some form of regional association is required, based on natural and therefore permanent and indestructible affinities which should outweigh superficial conflicts of interest and transcend temporary differences of political outlook.""

For the United Nations, the immediate challenge lies in the all-important field of security, and the first requirement is a strengthening of the will as well as of the machinery to keep the peace. The prompt decision of the Security Council in demanding a cease-fire between India and Pakistan has shown in a striking manner that the Council can effectively maintain the peace if the permanent members act together as intended by the Charter and if the non-permanent members play the prudent role of catalysts in achieving unanimous agreement. Every effort should be made to ensure that acting thus together for peace shall become the rule rather than the exception in the Security Council.

Such joint action appears mandatory when it is recalled that Communist China, preaching and practising a creed of hatred and violence, has deliberately tried to fan the flames of war in order to advance its own aggressive and expansionist aims. There is hardly any doubt that direct Communist Chinese intervention would provoke counter-intervention by other Powers, thereby setting off a world conflagration which, in this age of thermonuclear weapons, could lead us down the road to irreversible catastrophe.

It is in the context of the irresponsible conduct of Communist China in the Indo-Pakistan war that the Philippines reaffirms its opposition to the recognition of any right of the Peking regime to represent China in the United Nations. To do so would be to reward aggression and to condone that regimes unabashed policy of bellicosity against everybody who stands in the path of its arrogant ambition to dominate the world, including even its erstwhile friends and ideological allies. It would be tantamount to endorsing its sinister doctrine of the necessity of war, including nuclear war, as an instrument to ensure the triumph of the communist ideology. How could the General Assembly recognize a regime that holds the United Nations in profound contempt and openly espouses doctrines that are in absolute contradiction to the principles and purposes of our Charter?

With respect to the situation in Viet-Nam, the Philippines will continue to assist, within its means and on request, the Republic of Viet-Nam in its determined struggle to ward off communist infiltration and aggression. At the same time, we express the hope that it will be possible soon to arrange a cease-fire which will permit the parties in conflict to come to the conference table and work out a peaceful settlement.

As regards the question of Korea, the Philippines continues to support the objectives of the United Nations in Korea and the existence of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea to achieve these objectives. By the same token, the Philippines reiterates its support of the right of the German people to shape their own destiny in accordance with the principle of self-determination and within the framework of the peace and security of Europe.

The Philippines has co-sponsored with El Salvador and Nicaragua the request for the inscription of the item entitled ""Question of Tibet"" on our agenda [A/5931] because of the continued suppression of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the Tibetan people. The situation in Tibet remains a source of grave concern to the international community, and efforts should be exerted to achieve the objectives of General Assembly resolution 1723 (XVI).

The Philippines will continue to support the work of the Committee of Twenty-Four until the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)] is fully implemented and the last subject nation is brought to freedom. We should not relent in our efforts to complete the liquidation of colonialism. We should assist the colonial peoples not only to attain political independence, but also to become emancipated economically, to have control of their natural resources, and to direct their own commercial expansion and industrial development.

The Philippines will continue to do its share in combatting the racist policies of the Republic of South Africa. In line with our resolute opposition to the policies of apartheid, we are prepared to co-operate in carrying out further practical measures to put an end to this vicious form of racism and racial oppression.

As a member almost continuously since 1946 of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, the Philippines scarcely needs to reiterate its unfaltering devotion to the task of promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. As the twentieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights draws near, my delegation is more determined than ever that the United Nations lamp of human dignity and freedom, which started to shine like a beacon in 1948, shall illumine the farthest corners of the earth. Now that the covenants on human rights are approaching completion, the Costa Rican proposal to create the Office of United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights [A/5963] is both logical and timely, and the General Assembly should give it the careful consideration it deserves.

The Philippines maintains its loyal adherence to the rule of law, and considers that all Member States would do well to take the first essential step to demonstrate such adherence by accepting, without further delay, the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. It is in the context of this principle that the Philippines will continue to pursue its claim to Sabahor North Borneoa claim the determination of which remains an essential factor in the normalization of relations between the Philippines and Malaysia.

I should like to conclude this statement with a brief reference to recent developments in the economic field. We are now at the mid-point of the United Nations Development Decade. It is time to take stock of the progress made toward the goal we set four years ago: a minimum annual rate of economic growth of 5 per cent in the developing countries by the end of the Development Decade.

The first half of the Development Decade gives us little cause for complacency. Despite sustained effort during the last four years, the rate of growth achieved by the developing countries was well below the goal of 5 per cent, even lower than the growth rate during the second half of the previous decade. In contrast, the developed countries attained higher growth rates during this same period. The stern fact that emerges is that the gap between the rich nations and the poor, far from having narrowed, has grown even wider during the last four years.

Trade expansion is essential to the accelerated economic growth of the developing countries. The first four years of the Development Decade showed increases in their export earnings, but these, too, were proportionately lower than those of the developed countries, and below the average for the world as a whole. Consequently, the share of the developing countries in total world exports declined still further during the first half of the Development Decade.

Our efforts, both at the national and international levels, must, therefore, be redoubled. The international community must bring to the task of economic development even greater resources than have already been expended. Fortunately, during the first half of this decade, we have taken various initiatives and established the institutions that should orient us in the direction in which we must move. There was the decision to increase the resources of the International Monetary Fund and of the Bank and its subsidiary organizations; the move to reorganize and augment the resources available to the United Nations development programmes; the setting up of regional development banks; and the establishment of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. But what logically must come next are decisions expressive of the political will to ensure that these initiatives and institutions will yield optimum results.

Scarcely a year ago, the General Assembly established the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, through which it was hoped to reorganize the structure of international trade in order to meet the needs of the developing countries. In the intervening period, the Conference passed through its difficult organizational phase. That experience, we regret to say, has not left us very much heartened. While the Conference may have moved forward, the ground gained was neither easily won nor generously yielded. Indeed, we are concerned that the Conference might become, not a forum of international partnership and co-operation, but an arena of economic confrontation. The developing countries pin great hopes on the Conference on Trade and Development, and it would be tragic to see it reduced to impotence simply because our developed trading partners fail to perceive that its work cannot be concerned only with legal rights and obligations, which they stubbornly insist upon, but rather more with the application of justice and equity. The Conference seeks to rectify inequitable patterns of trade and commercial behaviour that have been imposed on the less developed countries through centuries of foreign domination.

While we worry about the political and ideological issues that have led or could lead to war, we should not forget that the most dangerous confrontations of the future will arise from an irreconcilable division of the world into rich nations growing richer and poor nations becoming poorer still. We shall not be able to avoid this fatal enmity unless the developed nations accept the obligation quickly and deliberately to modify their economic objectives and methods in order to favour the needs and aspirations of the less-developed and developing countries of the world. This is not the language of pessimism or extremism, but a simple statement of fact.

The establishment of regional development banks in Latin America, Africa, and now in Asia, is one of the finest examples of international co-operation in the field of economic development. The idea of an Asian development bank first took shape at the first Ministerial Conference on Asian Economic Co-operation held in Manila in December 1963. Its draft charter will be considered at the second Ministerial Conference, also to be convened in Manila before the end of this year. We hope that this will be followed immediately by a conference of plenipotentiaries, after which the Charter will be opened for signature. We are greatly heartened, therefore, by the positive response to this bank, particularly from the developed countries outside the Asian region. There can be no doubt that the Asian Development Bank will play a major, if not a decisive, role in the economic development of the countries in the Asian region. The offer of my Government of facilities in Manila for the bank headquarters demonstrates our trust and faith in its vital historic role, and I am glad to extend our official invitation on this occasion.

I have dealt with a number of questions that enjoy the highest priority in the agenda of the present session. Many of these questions concern Asia and are of the deepest concern to us. In recent years, my Government has tried to assist in the peaceful settlement of various disputes and conflicts in our region. At the same time, Manila, the capital of my country, has been a centre for new and promising initiatives toward intensified co-operation for trade and industrial development in the ECAFE region. Out of the experience I wish to pledge to you, Mr. President, and to the Assembly, the full and loyal co-operation of the Philippines in planning and carrying out a broad and effective United Nations programme for the improvement of the human condition and the defence of peace.

The preparation and execution of this programme of peace and well-being should receive tremendous impetus from the historic visit which His Holiness Pope Paul VI will make to the United Nations three days hence. The presence amongst us of this great man of peace, revered and beloved keeper of the most enduring spiritual values of mankind, shall be an inspiration for us all to strive harder for harmony and understanding. Recognizing the true meaning of his leadership, let us resolve to accept with dignity and humility the challenge of the message he will bring to us."	1965-10-01
Narciso G. Ramos	UNGA 22	"Allow me on behalf of my delegation to extend to you, Mr. President, our warm congratulations on your election to preside over the deliberations of the General Assembly at its twenty-second session. Your election as the first representative from the socialist countries of Eastern Europe to head the General Assembly is a significant event in the history of the United Nations. It symbolizes the gratifying degree of maturity, tolerance and understanding which the United Nations has attained since San Francisco and through the period of the cold war. We have come to realize that although our countries may profess divergent political beliefs, this should not deter us from devising a practical working relationship that would enable us together to strengthen the fabric of peace in the world and to advance the welfare of mankind.

I should also like to associate myself with the expressions of sincere admiration and appreciation which preceding speakers have addressed to the outgoing President of the Assembly, Ambassador Abdul Rahman Pazhwak of Afghanistan, for the able and statesmanlike manner in which he guided the deliberations of this body during one of the most critical periods of its existence.

Allow me to outline the views of my Government on some of the crucial issues confronting the international community.

Of the gravest concern to us is the situation in Viet-Nam. We are concerned not merely because of the geographic proximity of the Philippines to that country but because that land has become the testing-ground for the free world's determination to resist acts of subversion and aggression masquerading as wars of national liberation. The triumph of Hanoi and the Viet-Cong in South Viet-Nam would mean that movements of the same nature could with impunity be started anywhere in the world and pursued to success. It would give a new and more dangerous dimension to subversion and aggression, and no country anywhere would be immune. In the interest of our own national survival we do not wish to see this happen.

Let me pause at this juncture to say that we endorse wholeheartedly the proposal of Mr. Andrei Gromyko, the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union, in his policy statement on the necessity of accelerating the elaboration of the definition of aggression in the light of the present international situation [1563rd meeting]. We reject, however, his charge that my country, together with the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and the Republic of Korea, is an aggressor in Viet-Nam.

The Philippines, like the other allied nations, is in Viet-Nam in response to the plea of a sister nation for help in its life-and-death struggle to preserve its liberty and national identity against subversion from within and aggression from without. My country maintains a civic action contingent in South Viet-Nam. It is there in a non-combat capacity. It is engaged in medical, engineering and civic action projects, and seeks to assist the Viet-Namese people in their task of national reconstruction. We are in Viet-Nam to help, not to obstruct; to save, not to kill; to build, not to destroy.

The Viet-Namese people have endured war for nearly a quarter of a century. Today, the situation in that country constitutes a serious threat to the security of South-East Asia and to the peace of the world. We therefore anxiously desire an end to the Viet-Nam conflict. It has become clear that a political settlement would be the speediest and most practical method of ending the war, and we would welcome an agreement to that end. Indeed, the President of the Philippines, Mr. Ferdinand Marcos, stated before this Assembly last year [1411th meeting] that the Philippines eagerly looks forward to a negotiated settlement in Viet-Nam whereby both North and South, together with their respective allies, would agree to a cessation of hostilities until such time as the Viet-Namese people themselves can freely determine their own destiny in accordance with the principle of self-determination.

This continues to be our policy. We continue to support any initiative that could bring the war in Viet-Nam to the conference table. We agree with the Japanese delegation that the world should cease arguing as to which side is right and which is wrong, or which is the aggressor and which is the victim of aggression. What is urgent is that negotiations commence in order to bring this dangerous conflict to a speedy end. It is a matter of regret that in the past year efforts toward a pacific settlement failed to produce any positive results.

We would, however, emphasize that any peace negotiations must necessarily involve mutual accommodation. The suggested withdrawal of the allied forces from South Viet-Nam without a corresponding movement on the part of Hanoi can only lead to the aggravation of the situation, and hence must be rejected. We cannot agree that peace must be purchased at any price. The liberty and national identity of a valiant people are not commodities that can be traded, no matter how tempting the offer may be, in the marketplace of peace.

Nor is it wise to worry only about how soon the peace negotiations can begin; we must give some thought also to the question of how long the talks might last. The talks that ended the war in Korea lasted nearly two years, and so for two years longer the fighting went on and blood continued to flow. We must ask ourselves whether or not we want to see that kind of marathon peace talks in Viet-Nam.

We are encouraged by the progress which the Republic of Viet-Nam has made in the task of national reconstruction and in restoring civil government. Especially noteworthy are the results of the recent elections held there in the midst of a tragic war of national survival. The Soviet Foreign Minister has derisively described those elections as mere ""comedies"". We wonder, however, if the term is not more accurately descriptive of the elections held in certain countries where only one political party exists, where only one slate of candidates is permitted, and where the winning candidates garner an astonishing 99 per cent of the vote. In South Viet-Nam, there were eleven slates of candidates and the winning slate garnered only 35 per cent of the vote.

At this point, I wish to refer again to Mr. Gromyko's policy statement [1563rd meeting]. He spoke at great length about the conflict in Viet-Nam and about the problem of Germany. We thought it strange that Mr. Gromyko should have one prescription for peace in Europe and an exactly opposite prescription for peace in South-East Asia. Thus, he denounced the ""demands for a recarving of the political map of Europe"" [ibid., para. 112]; and the failure to understand ""the realities of present-day Europe"" and to respect the inviolability of its present boundaries made in Moscow, Paris, Warsaw or Berlin [ibid., para. 113] as dangerous threats to the peace of Europe. His formula for peace in Europe appears to be as follows: do not act in disregard of the present-day realities in Europe, do not disturb existing political settlements, do not attempt to impugn or attack the inviolability of boundaries, especially the boundary between West Germany and East Germany, including the wall that cuts Berlin in two. In short, Mr. Gromyko warned one and all not to disturb the status quo in Europe, lest the balance of forces on which the peace of that continent rests be dangerously tilted and upset.

For South-East Asia, on the other hand, Mr. Gromyko seems to favour a contrary formula. He proposes, in effect, that the present-day realities in South-East Asia be disregarded, that existing political settlements be set aside, that the political map of South-East Asia be recarved and existing boundaries between the two Viet-Namsand perhaps the two Koreas as wellbe obliterated, if necessary by force of arms. He does not want to preserve the status quo in South-East Asia, nor is he interested in maintaining a balance of forces on which the peace of the region could rest.

Without necessarily accepting as valid his prescription for peace in Europe, of which the principal ingredient is the permanent division of Germany, one is bound to ask by what logicother than the logic of the selfish interests of the Soviet Union and the international communist movementdoes he argue that an entirely contradictory set of principles is best for peace in Asia? Why is the principle of the inviolability of frontiers valid for Germany but inapplicable to Viet-Nam?

The Soviet Government, according to Mr. Gromyko, is committed to the permanent division of Germany and favours the admission of the two Germanys into the United Nations. We do not subscribe to such a policy whether as regards Germany or as regards Korea and Viet-Nam. We consider the truncation of these countries to be temporary, and we share the hope that some day their peoples will have the opportunity to decide freely on the issue of unification as part of a negotiated political settlement. But, meanwhile, we entirely agree with the Soviet view that existing boundaries and demarcation lines must be respected, and we maintain that this applies as much to Korea and Viet-Nam as it does to Germany.

This analysis would seem to indicate the existence of an inconsistency or contradiction in the Soviet policies towards Europe and towards Asia. Yet, on further analysis, there may not be any inconsistency or contradiction at all. The Soviet Union stoutly supports the status quo in Europe because it is clearly in its interest to do so. But the Soviet Union is not interested in supporting the status quo in South-East Asia, firstly, because it does not wish to give credence to Peking's fantastic allegation of collusion between the United States and the USSR in Viet-Nam; secondly, because the Soviet Union does not wish to oppose openly Peking's view that the status quo in South-East Asia must be violently overthrown in the interest of expanding the frontiers of the communist world; and thirdly, because the Soviet Union probably does not feel any particular obligation to help arrest a conflict that could lead to a direct confrontation between the United States and Communist China.

If this analysis of Soviet motives is either partly or wholly mistaken, we are ready to stand corrected. But how else is it possible to explain the persistent refusal of the Soviet Union to discuss and to seek a solution of the question of Viet-Nam in the United Nations or to reconvene the Geneva Conference?

No less serious as a threat to peace in South-East Asia and in the world at large is the situation in mainland China. We note with dismay the disturbing events occurring in that unhappy land. Communist China's recent nuclear explosions and the shrill threats of nuclear war which it now directs at the whole world are well known. We are also painfully aware of the recent violations of international law, particularly the blatant infractions of traditional diplomatic immunities, which have occurred in that country. That the incidents there appear to carry the sanction, nay the encouragement of the rgime in Peking is a matter for concern. No less disturbing is the inability or unwillingness of the States concerned to take a firmer stand against those violations.

If respect for law is to be upheld and if international justice is to be maintained as the basis of relations among States, we cannot let these transgressions pass unchallenged, lest by our indifference we contribute to a general breakdown of international law and order.

But even more pernicious are the miniaturized cultural revolutions which the political upheaval in Communist China has triggered off in many lands in Asia and Africa. It would seem that Communist China has perfected a new version of an old Communist export commodityrevolution. This is an export product the world can very well do without.

All this makes the question of the Chinese representation issue in the United Nations quite academic. A rgime that openly flouts the basic rules of international law and disregards the traditional norms of diplomatic conduct, that engages in nuclear blackmail, that rejects the principle of peaceful coexistence and proclaims the doctrine of perpetual revolution and the inevitability of war obviously has no place in this Organization. Certainly my delegation has no reason to change its stand on this issue.

While the excesses of the Red Guards in connexion with Mao Tse-tung's ""cultural revolution"" have caught the attention of the world, this is but a transient phase in that country's long and turbulent history. What constitutes a truly wholesome revolutionary development in Asia is the co-operative endeavour of the South-East Asian nations which have united themselves to secure peace, stability and progress for the peoples of the region. The movement towards regional organization and co-operation in South-East Asia represents an important milestone in the history of Asia. It holds out the promise of a better future for the nations of Asia and merits the support of the United Nations.

In Asia the need for economic and social development has received more attention than ever before. The Asian peoples have come to realize that there is no substitute for regional unity and co-operation. We in South-East Asia have gone beyond our national frontiers in search of friends and partners in the task of economic development. And we have achieved a measure of success. Thus, we now have the Asian Development Bank, with headquarters in Manila. The Association of Southeast Asia (ASA), composed of the Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand, has been reactivated. Within our modest resources many projects have been initiated, and since 1966 various conferences on economic, social and technical matters have been held in each of the three countries.

Only last month, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand established a new regional grouping, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations or ASEAN for short. Since this organization's purposes and membership coincide with those of the Association of Southeast Asia, it has been decided that the older and smaller group would eventually be absorbed into the newer and larger one.

Our region has also seen the organization of the Asian and Pacific Council (ASPAC), composed of nine members, whose activities are being geared to new needs in the economic, technical and social fields.

We hope and pray that the Middle East, cradle of civilizations and birthplace of religions, will once more become a haven of peace, tolerance and progress. We urge all Member States to refrain from making the Middle East, which is the geographic crossroads of three continents, a chessboard for great power ambitions. Instead of encouraging hate, fear and conflict among the peoples of that area, let us support their right to live together in peace, prosperity and freedom.

We have followed with great interest the efforts of the Eighteen-Nation Committee on Disarmament in Geneva to deal with a problem which has haunted us since the birth of our Organization. We hail its success in reaching agreement on a draft treaty to halt the spread of nuclear weapons. We know that no less than twenty-four countries possess the capability and the resources to become members of the nuclear club. Time, therefore, is of the essence. The gravest of perils would confront mankind if the draft treaty submitted by the United States and the Soviet Union for consideration by the General Assembly were to be unduly delayed or to fail to be adopted. We hope therefore, that the treaty will soon take its place as another milestone on the long and difficult road to general disarmament, together with the Antarctic Treaty of 1959, the nuclear test-ban Treaty of 1963 and the Treaty on Outer Space of 1967 [resolution 2222 (XXI)].

My delegation has also followed closely the efforts of the Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations to resolve the differences that divide our membership on the question. On the basic constitutional question, our position is well known. We believe that whenever the Security Council, which is vested with the primary responsibility under the Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security, should fail for any reason to discharge its responsibility, the General Assembly is clothed with residual authority and competence to take necessary measures to that end. We are pleased to note that the principle of the complementary roles of the Security Council and of the General Assembly has been confirmed by recent developments. During its fifth emergency special session, the General Assembly, at the request of the Soviet Union, took over the question of the Middle East crisis after a stalemate had developed in the Security Council.

This development foreshadows a possible breakthrough in the solution of the constitutional issue, and should lead to a generally acceptable formula on the financial aspects of the question. It is also our hope that while the search for such a formula goes on, the highly developed countries will make good their solemn pledge to offer voluntary contributions in order to meet the deficits that have been incurred by the United Nations in its peace-keeping operations.

Let me now turn to the question of colonialism. While we are gratified to note the accelerated pace of decolonization in recent years, we view with deep concern the continuing deterioration of the situation in South West Africa, in Southern Rhodesia, and in the Portuguese territories in Africa. We are, of course, pleased to see that the United Nations has terminated the Mandate of South Africa over South West Africa [resolution 2145 (XXI)] and, as a first step towards the achievement of independence and self-determination by its peoples, has established the United Nations Council for South West Africa [resolution 2248 (S-V)]. We are equally happy to see that that Council has been organized. The Council, however, faces a serious challenge and the Philippine delegation will support any proposal calculated to strengthen it in discharging its responsibilities.

The racial tension and strife in some countries underline the relevance and urgency of the work of the United Nations in combating racial discrimination and apartheid. The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination constitutes the inspiration and guiding force behind these efforts. The Philippines recently became the fourteenth Member State to ratify this historic convention and expresses the hope that it will soon come into force.

Once again we must declare our strong opposition to the policies of apartheid of the Republic of South Africa, which constitute the most pernicious and revolting form of racial discrimination known to man. So long as the policies of apartheid exist, the door will remain open to the danger of an international racial conflagration. The United Nations must unrelentingly press forward to overcome the resistance, indifference and ignorance which have prevented many countries from harmonizing their policies with the principles of the Charter and the objectives of many resolutions against racial discrimination and apartheid.

Now I should like to consider with the Assembly the most appalling and anachronistic spectacle of our time, the spectacle of a world divided into rich countries and poor nations, in which the rich are getting richer while the poor are becoming poorer still.

This situation was anticipated by the founding fathers when they incorporated in the Charter provisions for international co-operation to promote higher standards of living, full employment and conditions of economic and social progress. Have we been faithful to these objectives of the Charter? In all candour, we cannot answer in the affirmative. Many Member States have approached the problems of economic and social development with doubts and reservations, with ambivalent and equivocal actions. They have not offered the necessary remedies with sincerity and resolution. They have met the mounting needs of the developing nations half-heartedly, if not with deliberate indifference.

That certain modest gains have been achieved cannot be denied. The United Nations Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance has evolved into the United Nations Development Programme. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, and the United Nations Capital Development Fund have been established. There is intensified activity in the training of scientific, technical and administrative personnel in the developing nations; there is a more vigorous campaign on behalf of the World Food Programme; and the specialized agencies of the United Nations are doing their share of the massive task of alleviating the lot of the worlds sick, ignorant and hungry. But the basic need remains unsatisfied: namely, the need for more development capital made available to the developing countries on easier credit terms. Unfortunately, the developed countries, socialist as well as capitalist, with abundant resources to spare, have shown little readiness to respond to the need.

We are aware that the developing countries, many of which are politically emancipated but not yet economically decolonized, must learn to rely on their own efforts and resources. But even when they have done so, the developing countries will fall short of their objectives. On the other hand, since the developed countries cannot long endure as islands of prosperity surrounded by a sea of want and misery, it is clearly in their own interest to transfer more substantial resources to the developing countries in order to provide a firm foundation for an expanding world economy.

We have been told that the modest goals of the United Nations Development Decade, now in its seventh year, cannot be achieved. Thus, what promised to be a decade of development may yet turn out to be a decade of retrogression. There is danger in the seeming apathy of the developed nations towards the massive, sustained effort which is required to prevent the permanent division of the world into rich and poor nations. We must strike at the roots of this apathy and convince ourselves anew that we are members of one human family inhabiting one world and that we must act sincerely in the light of that conviction.

In conclusion, may I be permitted to recall that between this session and the preceding regular session the General Assembly was convened in the fifth special session and in the fifth emergency special session. The two special sessions left the world greatly discouraged by their failure to adopt effective practical solutions to the problems which called them into being. As a result of these successive frustrations of the General Assembly, disparaging remarks about the United Nations have been heard: that the Organization was ineffectual in discharging its responsibility to maintain international peace and security, that it was impotent and a failure.

As we begin the work of this regular session these harsh judgements tend to darken our view. Yet, this general debate in which we are now engaged should provide evidence of our renewed faith in the Organization and of our determination to live up to our responsibilities under the Charter. In spite of temporary setbacks and failures, no delegation sitting in this Assembly today would agree that our Organization has outlived its usefulness. We believe in the continuing validity of our Charter and in the enduring worth and value of our Organization. We are confident that, with patient and determined effort, we can overcome our difficulties and problems.

The United Nations remains the primary guardian of man's universal conscience. Despite its idealism, or perhaps because of it, this Organization is still mankind's best hope for peace and progress. As long as the United Nations exists, man's dream of a freer and more abundant life for all remains capable of fulfilment. Let us, therefore, strive to keep this Organization a living and dynamic body ever responsive to the needs and aspirations of mankind. This we must do for our own sake and for the sake of generations yet to come."	1967-09-25
Narciso G. Ramos	UNGA 23	"Let my first words be of congratulation to the President, and to the Government and people of Guatemala, on his unanimous election. We are fortunate indeed, and we have ample reason to congratulate ourselves, that we have him to preside over our deliberations at this session, for he brings to the Presidency eminent personal qualities, the prestige of the high position he holds in his own country, and a brilliant record of involvement in the work of the United Nations. The Philippines is linked to Guatemala by more than bonds of friendshipwe share with sister countries of Latin America the rich heritage of the great culture of Spainand the Philippine delegation takes genuine pride in his election. With our congratulations, we extend to him our assurances of unstinted co-operation in what we hope will be a fruitful session.

May I, at the same time, express our profound gratitude to the distinguished Foreign Minister of Romania, His Excellency Mr. Corneliu Manescu, for the wisdom, competence and tact with which he steered the General Assembly through its session last year.

To our 125th Member, Swaziland, the Philippine delegation extends its congratulations and a warm welcome. We are confident that it will make a meaningful contribution to the work of the United Nations. It is our hope that its people will find in independence the fulfilment of their aspirations for a better and fuller life.

Within the last twenty years, more than seventy-five countries have become independent, all of them with high expectations that independence would bring not only political freedom but also freedom from exploitation, from poverty, from fear. And they have pinned their faith and hope on the United Nations and on the principles enshrined in its Charter. Indeed, for a time we were heartened by the encouraging signs of dtente. The start of the peace talks in Paris, the agreement on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [see resolution 2373 (XXII)], the increased contacts among nations belonging to different economic and political systemsall these have encouraged the hope for enhanced international co-operation and peaceful coexistence based on the equal rights of nations, large or small. But peace continued to elude mankind's anxious grasp. In the Middle East, in parts of Africa, in our own part of Asia, war in one form or another is a tragic reality even as we meet here and pledge ourselves anew to the cause of peace.

Only a few weeks ago, the world witnessed another cynical violation of the rules of international law and order prescribed in the Charter of the United Nations. Naked force was applied against a Member of the United Nations by some of its own allies whose representatives have tirelessly championed the principle of peaceful coexistence and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States.

Today it is Czechoslovakia. Whose turn will be next? And when the world makes a tally of the results of that deplorable adventure, it must count the loss all Member States have sufferedthe setback to our common desire for the peaceful settlement of disputes and the destruction of the mood of confidence in international relations which we have all been trying so hard to promote. It is our hope that the Soviet Union will quickly correct its terrible blunder and bring about the immediate withdrawal from Czechoslovakia of troops of the Warsaw Pact Powers, leaving the gallant Czechoslovak people to decide their own future.

The conflict in Viet-Nam still remains the principal obstacle to peace and stability. The Paris conversations aroused expectations that remain unfulfilled and the pace of the talks has been most discouraging.

Nevertheless, the hope remains that, in a few months, the discussions will finally take a more meaningful turn. As one of the countries aiding the Republic of Viet-Nam in its struggle for freedom and existence, the Philippines is deeply interested in any negotiations involving that nation's ultimate destiny. The Philippines desires to see the South Viet-Namese people secure from internal subversion and external aggression, and guaranteed their right to form and maintain a government of their own free choice.

Nothing has happened on the mainland of China or in the outside world which would justify any change in decisions we have previously taken on the question of the representation of China. On the contrary, the Peking regime, by reason of the excesses of its so-called cultural revolution, its warlike policies towards its neighbours, and its continued oppression and persecution of the people of Tibet, has forfeited any right to represent the Chinese people in the United Nations. That right belongs to the Republic of China as a founding Member of the United Nations.

Let me now dwell on what the Secretary-General has called the ""most crucial and most challenging long-term struggle of this century"", namely, the struggle to narrow the widening gulf between the many countries that are poor and the few countries that are rich. The first United Nations Development Decade is nearing its end and the second Decade is about to begin.

The first Decade has seen modest successes in some fields and deepening frustrations in many others. One lesson we must learn from the first Development Decade is this: the second Development Decade will not succeed without a heightened awareness of the need for international co-operation and understanding. There are disheartening signs that many developed countries simply do not care. They have not increased their financial assistance and are not disposed to make changes in their patterns of international trade, technical assistance, investment, and external aid. These are manifestations of ""prosperous provincialism"" in international life, which the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, Mr. Prebisch, has correctly identified as a dangerous phenomenon growing in the affluent countries.

A recent sign of this return to isolationism was the action taken by the United States Congress to pare down to the barest minimum American aid to developing countries. The amounts of external aid approved by Congress were the lowest in two decades. Among the victims of the sharp pruning knife of Congress were the Asian Development Bank and the International Development Association. The former was to have received $200 million and the latter $160 million. These are relatively minor outlays and their elimination underscores the new indifference of the rich countries to the economic needs of the developing countries.

The developed countries are, after all, in a position to grant more aid. As a group, their gross national product between 1961 and 1966 grew by an unprecedented 25 per cent, while the net transfer of their resources increased by only 5 per cent. That is why we cannot understand why most of the developed countries have not reached the target of 1 per cent of their gross national product as external aid to the developing countries. Meanwhile, the developed countries spent about $175,000 million for armaments in one year alone. If only 10 per cent of that staggering amount were channelled to foreign aid, this world would be a happier, a kinder and certainly a safer place to live in.

The second Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, held in New Delhi early this year, does not augur well for the success of the second Development Decade. New Delhi gave no clear answers to the immense problems of development. For instance, in New Delhi, the developed countries agreed most reluctantly and only in principle, after intense and bitter negotiations, to the proposal for a generalized system of non-reciprocal and non-discriminatory tariff preferences and to the aid target of 1 per cent of their gross national product to the developing countries. However, the target date for those goals was not specified. These are, therefore, vague commitments at best, and the developing nations cannot relax their efforts, believing that the battle has been won.

There are other areas where the developed countries could be helpful if they wished. We refer to the need to ease the terms and conditions of aid. Some $4,500 million in interest and principal are now being repaid by developing countries. At present rates and terms, net development lending would become negative by 1975. The tying of aid should be reduced to the minimum since tied-aid cuts the benefits to the developing countries by as much as 15 per cent to 20 per cent. It may therefore be said that helping poor nations has become a highly profitable business.

Nothing in what we have said exempts the developing countries from their responsibilities. The primary responsibility for development must rest with the developing countries themselves. After all, four-fifths of the cost of development must come from domestic financing, and the rest from external sources. The developing countries must re-examine their development goals and objectives. My delegation believes that agricultural development should be given the highest priority, because agriculture will continue to be the main economic activity in the developing countries.

There is one revolution in this area which everybody welcomes. It is the so-called ""green revolution"" that has been brought about by the record production of rice, wheat and corn in a growing number of desperately hungry lands. In the Philippines, we have developed a new strain of rice with unprecedented yields, and sent seeds to all who ask for them. With this new variety, the Philippines will have a rice surplus for the first time in more than eighty years.

While according priority to agriculture, we must not neglect industrial development. For we know that, while agriculture may satisfy a nation's primary necessities, only industrialization can raise its living standards above the level of bare subsistence.

We should like to express, at this juncture, the abiding confidence of my Government in the United Nations family of organizations concerned with financial, technical and economic assistance. Our support for their work is amply demonstrated by the recent announcement by the President of the Philippines, Mr. Ferdinand E. Marcos, that the Philippines is increasing its contribution to the United Nations Development Programme for 1969 by 75 per centfrom $286,000 to $500,000. The Philippines is also increasing its contribution to the United Nations Childrens Fund by 70 per cent, from $110,104 to $186,860. To the World Food Programme, the Philippines pledged early this year the amount of 686,000 pesos, an all-time high. We hope that these increased contributions from a poor developing country like the Philippines might have some significance in a period of shrinking contributions from some of the developed countries. We are all engaged in a war against poverty, disease, hunger and misery. This is one war we can afford to escalate, and one which would benefit all mankind. 

It is said that one of the main reasons for the failure of the Development Decade was the serious oversight which resulted in the failure to integrate social with economic development. It is clear that this oversight must be corrected if the second Development Decade is to succeed. The draft declaration for social development [A/7161, annex I], which is in our agenda, sets the pattern for such integrated development, and we urge its adoption at this session. 

The Conference of Ministers Responsible for Social Welfare held last September in New York has come up with constructive recommendations to achieve social welfare goals through national effort and international co-operation. The Conference declared that social progress is the ultimate aim of all development and that a unique opportunity now exists for social welfare to make its full impact on national development. We urge that the Conference's recommendations to this end be adopted as soon as possible.

This year we mark the twentieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The International Conference on Human Rights held last April in Teheran adopted the Proclamation of Teheran. That historic document states, among other things, that the Universal Declaration ""constitutes an obligation for the members of the international community"" and that it has ""created new standards and obligations to which States should conform."" These are, in a sense, highly revolutionary affirmations which impose upon all countries the obligation to support measures designed to enhance the capacity of the United Nations to deal more effectively with violations of human rights wherever they may occur. We believe that the proposal to create the Office of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is such a measure, and we urge its early consideration by the Assembly.

During this International Year for Human Rights, the one lesson we should bear in mind is that we must never take human rights for granted. We cannot take them for granted so long as the evil of racial discrimination plagues so many national societies, and so long as one Member State of our Organization, the Republic of South Africa, continues to dignify apartheid as an official policy of the State. We must also recall that, during the invasion of Czechoslovakia, the invading forces took over the newspapers and the radio stations even before they captured the leaders of the Government. The first casualties were freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of information.

Permit me to take up now a problem that lately has cast an ominous cloud upon the South-East Asian scene: the dispute between the Philippines and Malaysia over Sabah, which is a large portion of North Borneo. The Philippines contends that it has acquired sovereignty and dominion over Sabah from the Sultanate of Sulu. Malaysia, on the other hand, asserts that it has acquired sovereignty and dominion over the territory from the United Kingdom.

The United Kingdom appears to have acquired its alleged sovereignty and dominion from the British North Borneo Company. That Company in turn derived its claim of sovereignty and dominion from Messrs. Overbeck and Dent. Those two gentlemen were the recipients of certain rights and privileges granted by Sultan Mohammed Jamalul Aslam and specified in a document signed by the said Sultan on 22 January 1878.

I have before me a photostat of the document that was signed by the Sultan of Sulu on 22 January 1878. It is in the Malay language, written in Arabic. The crux of the dispute concerns the proper interpretation that should be given to this document. The Philippines contends that it is a lease. Our opponents assert that it is a deed of cession or a sale.

From the beginning of this controversy on Sabahfirst with the United Kingdom and now with Malaysiathe Philippines has endeavoured to have the dispute elevated to the International Court of Justice for decision. We believe that the dispute is a legal dispute. Under Article 36, paragraph 3 of the Charter of the United Nations, legal disputes are, as a general rule, to be referred to the International Court of Justice for decision. Until now, we have not succeeded in getting the United Kingdom or Malaysia to agree to refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice.

An important provision of the agreement of 22 January 1878 between the Sultan of Sulu and Messrs. Overbeck and Dent refers to the obligation of the grantees or their successors in interest to pay to Sultan Mohammed Jamalul Aslam and ""to his heirs and successors"" the sum of $5,000 Malayan annually ""until the end of time"". The obligation to pay $5,000 Malayanwhich amount was later increased to $5,300 Malayan in 1903has been complied with successively by Messrs. Overbeck and Dent, by the British North Borneo Company, and by the British Government. The Federation of Malaysia also respects that obligation.

From the date the deed of 22 January 1878 was signed, payment was made annually until the year 1936, when Sultan Jamalul Kiram, then the reigning Sultan, died. The payment was suspended in 1936 because the British North Borneo Company wanted to be certain that the money they paid went to the right party or parties.

The late Sultan Jamalul Kiram died childless, but he left a will bequeathing his properties in the Philippines and in North Borneo to certain relatives named in that will. In 1939, upon the suggestion of British officials, the heirs of the deceased had to appear before the Superior Court of North Borneo to prove their right to succeed the deceased. Chief Justice Macaskie of the Superior Court of North Borneo adjudged the heirs of the late Sultan Jamalul Kiramthere were nine of themas the individuals entitled to receive the amount of $5,300 Malayan annually. Among other things, the Chief of Justice stated the following in his decision rendered on 18 December 1939:

""It is abundantly plain that the successors in Sovereignty of the Sultan of Sulu are the Government of Philippine Islands, but Mr. de Leon contends that the decision of the Philippine courts in the administration suit relating to the late Sultan's estate precludes that government from asserting any claim to the cession monies. In my view, this is correct. The Philippine Government allowed Sultan Jamalul Kiram to enjoy the cession monies as a private person since 1915; they have made no claim on his death and by a judgement of a Philippine court recognized the right of the private heirs of the Sultan to receive the cession monies.""

The pronouncement of Justice Macaskie I have just quoted treats of two subjects. The part which says: ""it is abundantly plain that the successors in sovereignty of the Sultan of Sulu are the Government of the Philippine Islands..."" obviously refers to rights of sovereignty, while the remainder of the paragraph refers to the proprietary rights of the heirs. According to Justice Macaskie, the rights of sovereignty go to the Government of the Philippine Islands while the proprietary rightsin the absence of any claim from the Philippine Governmentgo to the private heirs of the deceased.

It may be noted that Justice Macaskie has called the $5,300 Malayan ""cession monies"". This is because the plaintiffs in the suit brought before that judge did not have a copy of the original document dated 22 January 1878. The only document they had was the British translation of the deed, the Maxwell-Gibson translation, which called the transaction of 22 January 1878 a cession. This document was attached to the plaintiffs' complaint as one of their exhibits. Justice Macaskie had no other document before him and he had therefore no choice but to call the transaction of 22 January 1878 a ""cession"", and the amount of $5,300 Malayan ""cession monies"".

 The position of the Philippine Government on this point is that the Maxwell-Gibson translation of the deed of 22 January 1878 is erroneous. When, late in the year 1946, the Philippine Government finally came into possession of a photostat of the original document of 22 January 1878, in Arabic, it caused a translation to be made of that document. The different translations made of this documentone by the heirs of the late Sultan Jamalul Kiram, another by an American-language expert and a third by a Dutch-language expertall show that the 22 January 1878 agreement is a lease. It may also be stated that an early translation of the document made in Spain called it ""arendamiento"", or in English, ""lease"".

The important thing to remember here is that Justice Macaskie ruled that the amount of $5,300 Malayan was to be paid to the heirs of Sultan Jamalul Kiram every year up to the end of time. This decision of Justice Macaskie was respected by the British North Borneo Company, by the United Kingdom and by the Federation of Malaysia.

If the agreement signed by the Sultan of Sulu on 22 January 1878 were a sale, payment of the purchase price must end sometime. But the fact that payment must continue until the end of time indicates that the title to the property remained in the grantorthe Sultan of Suluwhile the grantees merely acquired leasehold rights and exercised powers of government expressly delegated to them by the Sultan of Sulu. Furthermore, a lease until the end of time is, in effect, the equivalent in English practice of a lease in perpetuity, and this does not exceed ninety-nine years.

 In addition to the deed of 22 January 1878, the Philippine Government intends to submit to the International Court for its consideration many other documents, among which are the following:

Commission from the Sultan of Sulu appointing Baron de Overbeck, Datu Bandahara and Rajah of Sandakans, also dated 22 January 1878, which expressly states that the Sultan of Sulu was delegating to Baron de Overbeck his powers of government;

The application for a Royal Charter filed by Messrs. Overbeck and Dent on 2 December 1878, which states, among other things, that the Sultan of Sulu was delegating to Baron de Overbeck his powers of government.

The letter of Earl Granville to Mr. Morier dated 7 January 1882. This letter from the British Foreign Office sets forth the official position of the British as regards the status of the British North Borneo Company after this Company was granted a Royal Charter. In the language of Earl Granville:

""The British Charter therefore differs essentially from the previous Charters granted by the Crown to the East India Company, the Hudson's Bay Company, the New Zealand Company, and other associations of that character, in the fact that the Crown in the present case assumes no dominion or sovereignty over the territories occupied by the Company, nor does it purport to grant to the Company any powers of government thereover; it merely confers upon the persons associated the status and incidents of a body corporate, and recognizes the grants of territory and the powers of government made and delegated by the Sultans in whom sovereignty remains vested.""?

The report of the British Acting Consul-General W. H. Treacher to the Earl of Derby dated 22 January 1878.
Mr. Treacher accompanied Baron de Overbeck to Jolo to negotiate with the Sultan of Sulu; he was present before and during the signing of the Deed on 22 January 1878. He acted as adviser to both Baron de Overbeck and the Sultan; and he signed the document as the only witness. His report to his superiors in London, made on the same day the Deed of 22 January 1878 was signed, should therefore carry considerable weight. He explained the basis for fixing the amount of $5,000 Malayan mentioned in the Deed. He stated in his report that at that time the Sultan's annual income from his dominions in North Borneo was $5,000 Malayan$3,000 from his pearl fisheries and $2,000 from his birds' nest caverns. And Mr. Treacher called the grant a concessionnot a cession.

The Philippine Government has many other documents to present to the Court for consideration. The ones mentioned above have been cited as examples in order to show this body that the settlement of the dispute calls for the consideration and evaluation of agreements, contemporaneous correspondence and other documents which are proper for a judicial body to pass upon. 

It is obvious even from a cursory examination of the documents to be considered in the determination of the issues involved in the dispute that the International Court of Justice is the organ of the United Nations that should take cognizance of the dispute between the Philippines and Malaysia. It is the body best suited to handle such a complex dispute.

In the case that Malaysia agrees to elevate the dispute to the Court, the Philippines will be prepared to abide by whatever decision that judicial body may render. If the decision of the Court is in favour of Malaysia, that will be the end of the Philippine claim. If the decision is in favour of the Philippines, that will not be the end of the case. For the Philippines is committed to the principle of self-determination and would be prepared to ensure the observance of that principle in Sabah.

The position of the Philippines is that the legal settlement should precede the political settlement. By legal settlement we mean adjudication by the Court. By political settlement we mean a settlement based on the results of a plebiscite. Our position was enunciated by the President of the Philippines in a message to the Congress of the Philippines on 28 January 1963, as follows:
""In laying claim to North Borneo in pursuance of the legal and historic rights and the security interests of the Philippines, we recognize the cardinal principle of self-determination of which the Philippines has been a steadfast adherent. In the prosecution of our valid claim, it is agreeable to us that, at an appropriate time, the people of North Borneo should be given an opportunity to determine whether they would wish to be independent or whether they would wish to be a part of the Philippines or be placed under another state. Such referendum, however, should be authentic and bona fide by holding it under conditions, preferably supervised by the United Nations, that would ensure effective freedom to the people of North Borneo to express their true and enlightened will.""?

The Philippines has been charged with a failure to abide by the results of an ascertainment made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in 1963. We need not dwell at length on this matter. Suffice it to say that the commitment of the Philippines to welcome the formation of Malaysia was made subject to the final outcome of the Philippine claim. This condition was expressly stated in the following three documents: 

(1) Report and Recommendations of the Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Federation of Malaya, the Republic of Indonesia and the Republic of the Philippines to their respective Heads of Government, dated 11 June 1963. Paragraph 12 of that document reads:
*""The Philippines made it clear that its position on the inclusion of North Borneo in the Federation of Malaysia is subject to the final outcome of the Philippine claim to North Borneo. The Ministers took note of the Philippine claim and the right of the Philippines to continue to pursue it in accordance with international law and the principle of pacific settlement of disputes. They agreed that the inclusion of North Borneo in the Federation of Malaysia would not prejudice either the claim or any right thereunder. Moreover, in the context of their close association, the three countries agreed to exert their best endeavours to bring the claim to a just and expeditious solution by peaceful means, such as negotiation, conciliation, arbitration, or judicial settlement as well as other peaceful means of the parties' own choice, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and the Bandung Declaration.""

(2) The Manila Accord of 31 July 1963. This Accord signed by President Macapagal, President Sukarno and Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman adopted in toto the report of the Foreign Ministers as quoted above.

(3) The Joint Statement of 5 August 1963. Paragraph 8 of that document reads as follows:

**""In accordance with paragraph 12 of the Manila Accord, the three Heads of Government decided to request the British Government to agree to seek a just and expeditious solution to the dispute between the British Government and the Philippine Government concerning Sabah (North Borneo) by means of negotiation, conciliation and arbitration, judicial settlement, or other peaceful means of the parties' own choice in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations. The three Heads of Government take cognizance of the position regarding the Philippine claim to Sabah (North Borneo) after the establishment of the Federation of Malaysia as provided under paragraph 12 of the Manila Accord, that is, that the inclusion of Sabah (North Borneo) in the Federation of Malaysia does not prejudice either the claim or any right thereunder.""

I should like to invite particular attention to the phrase ""after the establishment of the Federation of Malaysia"" used in the Joint Statement of the President of the Philippines, the President of Indonesia and the Prime Minister of Malaya. The thought is clearly expressed in the Joint Statement that after the establishment of the Federation of Malaysia, the Philippines will continue to pursue its claim to Sabah. The Tunku accepted this idea when he agreed to the Joint Statement. 

Finally, it may be stated that, upon the normalization of relations between the Philippines and Malaysia, in 1966, the two Governments, under the communique of 3 June 1966, ""agreed to abide by the Manila Accord of 31 July 1963 and with the Joint Statement accompanying it, for the peaceful settlement of the Philippine claim to Sabah,"" and further expressed recognition of the ""need of sitting together, as soon as possible, for the purpose of clarifying the claim and discussing the means of settling it to the satisfaction of both parties in consonance with the said Manila Accord and Joint Statement."" By agreeing to discuss anew the Philippine claim and the modes of settling it, Malaysia voluntarily forfeited any advantage which it might have acquired under the United Nations ascertainment of 1963.

As to the Sabah elections of 1967, they cannot be properly cited as favouring Malaysia's legal right to Sabah. Only the election of local officials was concerned in the proceedings. The question of whether the people of Sabah wished to remain with Malaysia or to join the Philippines was not asked in the ballots issued to voters, and hence was not squarely put in issue. By no stretch of the imagination could the 1967 Sabah elections be regarded as a plebiscite.

The new Federation of Malaysia was proclaimed on 16 September 1963. Several times after that date, the Federation of Malaysia committed itself to discuss with the Philippines the best means of settling the dispute. Towards the end of 1964, through an exchange of aides-mmoires, the two countries agreed to hold talks on the clarification of the Philippine claim and on the best means of settling it. In a note verbale dated 7 February 1966, the Government of Malaysia put itself on record ""that it has never moved away from the Manila Accord of 31 July 1963 and the Joint Statement accompanying it and reiterates its assurance that it will abide by these agreements, particularly paragraph 12 of the said Manila Accord and paragraph 8 of the Joint Statement."" Again on 3 June 1966, through the joint communiqu issued by the two Governments, Malaysia committed itself to abide by the Manila Accord of 31 July 1963, and with the Joint Statement accompanying it.

Early this year, on the occasion of the State visit of the President of the Philippines to Kuala Lumpur, another joint communiqu was issued, calling for talks which the Philippines hoped would lead to an agreement on the best means of settling the dispute. Finally, through an exchange of notes in the months of April and May 1968, the two Governments agreed to hold talks in Bangkok for the purpose of clarifying the Philippine claim and discussing the modes of settling it.

The talks in Bangkok started on 17 June of this year. For several days the Malaysian delegates asked questions ostensibly to clarify the Philippine claim. All questions asked were answered. However, when the Philippine delegates became convinced that enough questions had been asked and sufficient answers had been given, they proposed that the two groups start a discussion on the mode of settlement. The Malaysian refused.

The Philippine delegation then asked the Malaysian delegation whether they would agree to discuss modes of settlement irrespective of a unilateral assessment on their part that the Philippine side had not clarified the Philippine claim to their satisfaction. They gave a written affirmative answer. A short recess followed. When the talks resumed, the Philippine delegates, convinced that the Philippine claim had already been plainly set forth in two volumes of a publication entitled Philippine Claim to North Borneo (Sabah), which had been made available to the Malaysian Government many months before, that enough questions had been asked and sufficient answers already given, and that the period of clarification was over, proposed that the two delegations pass on to a discussion of the modes of settlement. A four-day recess followed, during which the Malaysian delegation announced to the world press that, acceding to the Philippine request, they would discuss modes of settlement at the meet"	1968-10-15
Carlos P. Romulo	UNGA 24	"Madam President, it has been ten years since I last took part in the deliberations of the General Assembly. I consider it a privilege to return to this rostrum as leader of the Philippine delegation and in that capacity to extend to you my sincere felicitations on your election to the highest office attainable in this distinguished body.


Twenty years ago, as President of the fourth session of the General Assembly, I had the great honour of occupying the same exalted position. I remember it as a unique vantage point, providing an exhilarating view of the state of the world. But it is also the point of convergence of the world's problems. I know from experience what a lonely eminence the office of President can be and how heavy its burdens can become. My assurance, therefore, of the unstinting support and co-operation of my delegation is more than a ritualistic gesture. It is a token of recognition of the magnitude of your task and an expression of earnest hope for your success as President of what we all pray will be a constructive and fruitful session of the Assembly.


The sombre context of our deliberations has been accentuated by the death in office of your distinguished predecessor, Mr. Arenales of Guatemala. He was a man of brilliance and perception. He had an even rarer quality: moral courage. At the risk of being misunderstood, of becoming unpopular, he dared to do his duty by speaking what he conceived to be the truth about certain weaknesses of the United Nations. His intellectual honesty was matched by his uncompromising devotion to the high office entrusted to him. We feel his loss keenly.


Permit me first of all to state the Philippine position on some of the pressing problems on our agenda.


We share the profound concern about the deteriorating situation in the Middle East, where the protagonists appear to be once again on the brink of open war. We have pondered this intractable problem deeply, weighing carefully in our minds and in our consciences the various solutions proposed. Mindful of the claims, the interests and the aspirations of both sides, and considering them in the context of the common need for the restoration of peace with justice in that troubled area, we maintain our support for the Security Council's resolution of 22 November 1967 [242 (1967)] as the basis for an equitable settlement.


We remain opposed to the admission of Communist China into the United Nations and this is a position we shall maintain as long as Communist China pursues its intransigent policies and its support of so-called wars of national liberation which so often masks aggression by proxy. Like its other Asian neighbours, we are prepared to coexist with Communist China and the Chinese people but we have a right to insist that coexistence be based on mutual respect and scrupulous regard for international law.


We look forward to a negotiated settlement of the war in Viet-Nam but frankly hope that it will not be a peace at any price. The people of South Viet-Nam have the fundamental right to determine freely their own destiny in accordance with the principle of self-determination. They have earned that right in the crucible of war. They should not be deprived of it at the peace table.


We note with alarm and anxiety the lack of progress reported by the Secretary-General in the crucial field of disarmament. This continuing impasse, reflecting a basic disagreement between the two super-Powers, fosters a global climate of insecurity which makes it more difficult to settle particular disputes like those in the Middle East and Viet-Nam. We shall lend our full support to all initiatives towards effective disarmament and international control of strategic nuclear weapons and the prevention of the development, production and stockpiling of chemical and bacteriological (biological) weapons.


We remain fully committed to the protection and promotion of fundamental human rights, mindful of the fact that their violation anywhere in the world constitutes a direct threat to peace as well as a derogation of the essential dignity of man.


At this juncture I should like to refer brieflyand in the most friendly wayto the Philippine claim to Sabah. We are pledged to pursue this claim only by peaceful, orderly means under the rule of law, and therefore we reiterate our standing proposal to submit the case to the International Court of Justice, by whose decision the Malaysian Government and ourselves should abide. This step is in consonance with the Manila Accord of 1963, under which Malaysia and the Philippines agreed:


 to bring the claim to a just and expeditious solution by peaceful means, such as negotiation, conciliation, arbitration or judicial settlement as well as other peaceful means of the parties own choice in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and the Bandung Declaration.


I submit that it is hardly possible to envisage a more friendly and reasonable approach to this particular problem. A further touchstone of Philippine sincerity in this matter is our continued co-operation with Malaysia in the regional economic and social programmes of ASEAN, the Association of South-East Asian Nations, which also includes our good neighbours, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand. Moreover, the Philippines, having regard to Malaysias recent difficulties, has exercised the utmost restraint with respect to this question, which, we continue to hope, could be adjudicated by mutual consent.


I now turn to the more general issues of concern to this Assembly. It gives one pause to realize that the United Nations is not yet a quarter of a century old. In 1944, as an observer for the Philippines, which at that time had not yet regained its independence, I was a witness to the historic initial steps to organize the United Nations at Dumbarton Oaks in Washington, and afterwards I had the honour to lead the Philippines delegation at the formal founding of the United Nations in San Francisco. That was in 1945, only twenty-four years ago. Yet it seems already to belong to another age.


The reason is partly because the pace of change in our world has become so rapid that it is no longer measurable by the ordinary time scale, and partly because its depth and scope are transforming life and society everywhere on our planet to a degree unprecedented in history. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that we are today living in a different world from the one for which the United Nations Charter was designed twenty-four years ago.


Among the changes affecting the structure of the United Nations is the emergence of super-Powers possessing ultimate weapons in over-kill quantity but unable to impose peace and order in the world. None of us who signed the Charter in San Francisco knew anything about the atom bomb.


Another is the emergence of Africa as a major factor in world affairs.


Yet another is the dynamic resurgence of Asia after centuries of lethargy under Western domination. China, whose ancient civilization was a fertile source of inventions helpful to the build-up of Western power and affluence, has acquired the nuclear technology needed to reclaim its place among the great Powers. Then again, responding belatedly to the challenge of the industrial revolution, Japan nevertheless has forged to the front rank of today's economic giants, sparking what may turn out to be a new Asian renaissance.


It is also in Asia that the political limits to the exercise of great military power are being most sharply defined and restrained. Asia is in the process of firmly establishing a principle applicable to other regions, namely, that Asian problems are primarily the concern and responsibility of the Asian countries themselves.


Theythe Asiansare asserting, in the words of His Excellency President Ferdinand E. Marcos of the Philippines, their right to ""a rule compatible with the recovered dignity of their new status, and, in keeping with the purposes of Asian nationalism, demanding that others place their relationship with them on a basis of equality and mutual respect.""


Relevant to the new relationship between Asian and non-Asian Powers that might be formed after the war in Viet-Nam has ended is President Marcos' perceptive warning:


""To function in Asia without full Asian support is to build on shifting sand. The greater the power projected from outside into Asia, the more compelling the need that it should operate in harmony with Asian aspirations, towards goals compatible with Asian independence and dignity.

There is a portentous stirring among the peoples of Asia today as they become more and more deeply involved in the great enterprise of transforming their ancient societies through economic and social development. As in other parts of the developing world, Asias youth is in the forefront of this gathering march towards that glittering goal of the Charter: better standards of life in larger freedom.

I believe that this Assembly should pay special attention to the emergence of youth as one of the most important factors in the process of change in the developing countries. The Secretary-Generals observations on this point are worth pondering. In his statement at the opening of the forty-seventh session of the Economic and Social Council in Geneva on 14 July 1969, he finds that: 

""... while science and technology speed forward with inventions and discoveries which were beyond imagination even a few decades ago, young people are less content with the sluggishness of the institutions and the structures of political, economic and social life. Many of them are impatient, understandably impatient, with injustice and they question the existing channels of institutional change

""It seems obvious that, during the years ahead, societies all over the world will have to adapt their priorities and allocate their resources to take into account the demands of youth.""

I feel that it would be useful to bring to the Assembly's attention the conclusions of some of the past Presidents of the General Assembly, some Permanent Representatives and other friends of the United Nations who participated in the fourth conference on the United Nations of the next decade which was held in Quebec from 22 to 27 June 1969 under the auspices of the Stanley Foundation. A sense of profound, pervasive, revolutionary change, presenting mankind with both danger and opportunity, informed their deliberation and manifests itself in the joint statement in which they sought to convey a message of warning well worth reiterating from this rostrum. It is a warning that coincides with the significant alert sounded by Secretary-General U Thant in the introduction to his report that is before usa report which is marked by a sustained tone of gloom, and in which he says that ""time is running out"" [A/7601/Add.1, para. 198] for efforts to save world peace. The Quebec statement of past Presidents and Permanent Representatives and students of political science declared:

""As we enter the 1970s, the world sits on time bombs: an accelerating arms race, rising racial hostility, exploding population, the widening economic development gap and the lag of human institutions behind scientific progress.

""Major changes in the United Nations are needed to make it more capable of maintaining peace, justice and freedom under law ...

""New opportunities lie before us. New roles for the United Nations are opened by world problems such as population, pollution, and the new frontiers of the sea-bed and outer space. Increasing international contacts and the growing interdependence of nations compel new forms of co-operation. The failures of old structures and programmes open the door for new. The idealism of many young people, and their determination to participate in building a better world, should be enlisted to strengthen the United Nations.

""The twenty-fifth birthday of the United Nations in 1970 should be more than mere ceremony. It is time for a searching examination of the strengths and weaknesses of the United Nationsand new determination to make the United Nations adequate to the dangers and opportunities of the 1970s.""

Those are the considered views of some of the past Assembly Presidents and a group of political scientists and United Nations representatives who conferred in Quebec on the role of the United Nations in the coming decade. Their suggestion that major changes be made to update the United Nations and make it a more efficient instrument for achieving the goals of the Charter deserve, I believe, the most careful consideration by this Assembly.

During their tenure, these past Presidents served the General Assembly with the whole-hearted dedication that has become an honoured tradition. They have since kept in close touch with United Nations affairs, meeting together with other close observers and students of the world Organization in 1965 in San Francisco, in 1967 in Burgenstock, Switzerland, and again in 1968 in Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia. The joint statement of their meeting last spring, to which I have referred, is a succinct summing-up of the most urgent of the major concerns of the United Nations. More than that, it provides the basis for an agenda for constructive action in the next decade.

A fundamental review of the structure, powers, and procedure of the United Nations is an important item in the Quebec agenda. It is a proposal which my delegation considers both appropriate and timely. It is true that the purposes and principles of the Charter were, in a very real sense, written for the agesvalid not only for this generation or the next but also for the generations to follow. But the machinery and the methods for their realization were not meant to be immutable. After twenty-four years, it is certainly necessary to scrutinize them closely and see how they may be made more useful and effective in our rapidly changing world.

That was the reason for the provision in Article 109 for a General Conference to review the Charter ten years after its coming into force. That Conference unfortunately was not held; we were told by the great Powers that it might open a Pandora's box of problems. No one has checked if the lock on that Pandora's box has remained in place. If it has, the box itself must be full of holes, because the problems it is supposed to contain are out in force, bedevilling the United Nations and its Member countriesand making it an ineffective instrument for peace.

First in 1955, then in 1966, the Philippines formally reiterated its proposal for a review of the Charter. On 21 September 1966, in his address to the General Assembly, President Marcos declared: 

"" ... the review and revision of the Charter ... already years overdue ... can no longer be deferred. A whole new world has emerged""  and come into being in the twenty years since San Francisco  ""the Charter should faithfully reflect the realities and the vital needs of this new world. Only thus can the United Nations become an instrument fully responsive to the aims and aspirations of Member nations ..."" [1411th meeting, para. 29].

""For the United Nations itself, there is a clear and admitted need to perfect its organization, to improve the techniques employed in its manifold operations, and to bring to its work, particularly in the developing countries, an ever greater sense of mission and dedication."" [Ibid., para. 28.]

My delegation would like to see included in the agenda of the next session of the General Assembly, coinciding with the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, an item on the review of the United Nations Charter. We envisage three main areas of change. 

The first would be functional. It would include measures to ensure: first, that this general debatethis important function in which we are now engagedshould be more meaningful, more productive, less wordy, and closely geared to the vital problems confronting the Assembly, not local, parochial, national problems, intended only for home consumption; secondly, that the decision-making process, including the voting procedures, should facilitate the taking of more effective and realistic decisions capable of being translated into viable programmes enjoying wide support; and thirdly, that there should be more effective co-ordination of United Nations activities and programmes, with overlapping agencies duly integrated and assessment procedures established to make certain that maximum results are achieved and that proliferation of agencies stop.

The second principal area of change would be, in the broad sense, political. It would include measures to improve the peace-keeping capacity of the United Nations; enhance its ability to initiate collective security arrangements in areas vulnerable to aggression or subversion; and augment its resources for conciliation, mediation and arbitration of international disputes.

The third main area of change would be in the economic and social fields. It would centre on measures to facilitate the formulation of a global strategy for development, based on a workable partnership between the rich and the poor nations intended to bridge the steadily widening poverty gap which threatens to tear the international community asunder in the coming decade. This is a crisis we must watch because it is coming.


In due course, the Philippine delegation will submit specific proposals spelling out the changes I have briefly touched upon. We are well aware that structural reforms alone will be futile without the will to translate the Charter into reality. But we consider it wise to have the instrument ready when the will to make it work manifests itself, as it must if the survival of man in conditions of dignity and peace is to be assured.

This is all the more necessary, in our view, as the time draws near for embarking on the Second United Nations Development Decade. The preparations for this momentous undertaking should provide a common ground for the concerted efforts required to cope successfully in the 1970s with the same formidable challenge that the First Development Decade, unfortunately, has failed to surmount.

On the part of the United Nations, two major reviews of far-reaching implications to international co-operation for economic development are in the process of being completed. The first is Sir Robert Jackson's ""capacity study"" for the United Nations Development Programme. The second is the ""grand assize"" of international assistance for the past two decades which the World Bank has commissioned another past President of the General Assembly, Mr. Lester Pearson, to conduct. It is our earnest hope that these two searching reviews will help provide a firmer basis for the vastly expanded international effort needed to ensure the success of the Second Development Decade.

For their part, the developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America should consult more closely together on a common strategy for the coming decade. The Government of Chile has taken a commendable initiative in gaining the support of the developed countries for a declaration of Latin American views of how to accelerate economic and social development in the 1970s as expressed in the historic consensus of Villa del Mar of 17 May 1969. In the Organization of African Unity the African countries have an effective instrument for consultation and joint planning. A parallel effort could be made by the Asian countries. Collaboration within UNCTAD makes available to the three regional groups workable modes of high-level co-operation which could be expanded to suit the requirements of a common strategy for the Second Development Decade.

On the part of the developed countries, what is required above all is the basic decision, duly reflected in their policies on international aid and trade, to help the developing countries achieve the target of 6 to 7 per cent annual average growth rate in the next decade. The Secretary-General, in his statement at the opening session of the conference on the Second United Nations Development Decade on 9 May 1969, considers it

""... tragic that, at the very moment in history when assistance efforts are beginning to yield results, public and official support in the aid-giving countries appears to be weakening"".

The Secretary-General says that that is tragic, and I believe it is more than tragic, it can be fatal.

The Secretary-General finds it ironic that many people in the rich countries who realize the cost and the dangers of neglecting poverty at home ""seem unable to apply the lessons of their domestic experience to the shrinking world in which they live"".

In his statement at the opening of the Economic and Social Council, the Secretary-General notes that adequate resources are available, given the political will to use them. He says:
""I continue to be struck by the magnitude of the stake and the relatively limited sacrifice, in financial terms, which would be needed to improve on the past trends in the economic growth of the developing countries: only a slight reduction in expenditure on armaments would suffice to make available the external resources required for solving at least some of the gravest economic and social problems of today's world.""

Implicit in all these is the imperative need for a more decisive commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter on the part of all Members of the United Nations. The problems of peace and development transcend national and regional boundaries. They underline the inescapable reality of our interdependent world.

Three years ago the President of the Philippines reminded the General Assembly [1411th meeting] that the unresolved threat of nuclear annihilation imposed a desperately short deadline on United Nations efforts to ensure mankind's survival. Again this is underscored by Secretary-General U Thant in the introduction to his annual report [A/7601/Add.1] now before us.

On 9 May 1969, in his statement at the opening session of the conference on the Second United Nations Development Decade, the Secretary-General issued this warning:
""I do not wish to seem overdramatic, but I can only conclude from the information that... the United Nations have perhaps ten years left in which to subordinate their ancient quarrels and launch a global partnership to curb the arms race, to improve the human environment, to defuse the population explosion, and to supply the required momentum to world development efforts. If such a global partnership is not forged within the next decade, then I very much fear that the problems I have mentioned will have reached such staggering proportions that they will be beyond our capacity to control.""

With characteristic wit, the late John F. Kennedy illuminated one aspect of the problem most pertinent to the Second Development Decade. He said: ""If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich."" Let us repeat that. ""If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.""

If I have voiced some thoughts that are critical of this Organization and some aspects of its work, it does not mean that my delegation has lost faith in the United Nations. On the contrary, we would like to enhance its effectiveness because we believe in it.

The Philippine people are among the founding Members of the United Nations. Our belief in the freedom and dignity of man, our hopes for the future, and our commitment to the kind of world in which those hopes could find fulfillment are embodied in the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, in the drafting of which we had the privilege of having a hand.

Our support of the United Nations, through the vicissitudes of its first two decades, has been firm and unstinting. It will remain steadfast through whatever trials and ordeals may lie ahead. Twenty years ago, when I had the inestimable privilege of presiding over the General Assembly, the cold war was at its height. In the aftermath of the Berlin blockade, the danger of a third world war appeared to be a very real one. Then the Korean War exploded. I confess, I spent many a sleepless night thinking of ways to help reduce tensions and develop modes of accommodation between the contending sides.

But on the supreme question of man's ability and will to surviveand not only to survivebut to persevere in his everlasting quest for the fullness of freedom and dignitymy faith has never wavered; and that faith is as strong today as it was twenty years ago."	1969-09-22
Carlos P. Romulo	UNGA 25	"May I say to the delegation of Malaysia that the Philippine delegation shares in its grief at the passing of one of its members, Ambassador Ramani, an able and distinguished diplomat. On behalf of my delegation I extend to Malaysia our heartfelt condolences.


Permit me first of all to conform with tradition. I congratulate the Assembly for having wisely elected as President of this historic session a distinguished representative of the country which gave the United Nations its first Secretary-General. To you, Mr. President, I offer my cordial felicitations and the assurance of the same unstinting co-operation which my delegation gave to your able predecessor, Mrs. Angie Brooks-Randolph of Liberia.


As we launch the Second United Nations Development Decade and confront the challenge of the 1970s, you have a tower of strength at your side in the person of Secretary-General U Thant, a man of outstanding ability and incorruptible integrity.


Now, permit me to break with tradition. The full text of my policy statement, which would have taken at least thirty minutes to deliver, has been distributed and will be circulated subsequently as an addendum to the verbatim record of this meeting. What I shall now deliver is a ten-minute summary of that policy statement. 


The Secretariat has agreed to the following arrangements: that the full text of the statement to be inserted in the addendum of the record of these proceedings is not to exceed ten typewritten pages, single spaced, and that the reading time of the full text, if delivered, is not to exceed thirty minutes; and that in order that there shall be no abridgement of the right of reply, the full text of the statement must be circulated to all delegations twelve hours before deliverywhich we have doneand on the day of delivery the full text will be again circulated to each delegation in the General Assembly. Again I repeat, the full text will be subsequently circulated as an addendum to the verbatim record of this meeting.

I hope that this innovation will not only save time and expense, but also help make future general debates more relevant and more meaningful.

Now for the position of the Philippine delegation on the various questions facing the General Assembly.

My delegation urgently reiterates the Philippine proposal, first broached in 1955, that a fundamental review of the United Nations Charter be undertaken in accordance with Article 109.

At the very least, we should decide during this twenty-fifth anniversary session to form a preparatory committee for the review of the Charter, with terms of reference covering the three main areas of constitutional changes which my delegation outlined to the Assembly last year [1760th meeting].

A paramount aim should be to strengthen the peace-making capacity of the United Nations so that it could defuse the threat of renewed war in the Middle East, mediate actively to put an honourable end to the war in Viet Nam, and play a central role in the crucial issue of disarmament and nuclear arms controlwhich affects not only the security, but also the survival of mankind.

Deeply concerned at the breakdown in law and order implicit in the hijacking of civilian aircraft, my delegation is co-sponsoring a new agenda item to enable the Assembly to consider effective means of countering this new form of international piracy. Our proposal is motivated by humanitarian concerns and has no political or ideological motivations.

We give our full support to the suggestion that all Member States should voluntarily accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. Again, we appeal to the Government of Malaysia, our good friends, to agree to have the Philippine claim to Sabah adjudicated by the Court. We have a high regard for the new Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Abdul Razak, and we hope he will co-operate in having this question settled once and for all, in a manner worthy of our two countries friendly relations and our shared membership in the United Nations.

While hoping that our big neighbour, Communist China, will eventually merit membership in accordance with the Charter, we shall maintain our opposition, which is not permanent, to its admission so long as it shows no desire to join the United Nations and abide by its rules.

We deplore the lag in the promotion of human rights and in the process of decolonization.

We share the deepening concern over the pollution of our environment and protest the use of the Pacific Ocean for nuclear tests that could disturb its complex and delicate ecological balances.

My delegation will support intensified United Nations action to extend assistance for family planning and population control to Governments which request such aid. We favour the establishment of a sub-regional population centre in South-East Asia with international support.

The fulfilment of youth's legitimate aspirations is of special interest to my delegation. We would welcome United Nations action for greater participation of youth in international affairs.

We subscribe to the integrated, unified approach taking equal account of the economic and social factors in national development, and would like to see this concept fully reflected in the strategy and programmes of the Second United Nations Development Decade. Insufficient attention to the social factor was one of the causes of the failure of the First Development Decade. We do not wish to see that mistake repeated.

On the whole, my delegation finds the international development strategy drafted by the Preparatory Committee for the Second United Nations Development Decade [A/7982, para. 1b] worthy of commendation and support. However, it is weakened by reservations on matters indispensable to the success of the Decade, such as the amount of resources to be transferred by the rich to the poor countries, target dates for easing onerous terms of aid, and effective measures to eliminate trade barriers and give developing countries wider access to markets in industrialized countries.

I would appeal to the delegations concerned to withdraw these reservations as a token of that decisive commitment without which the Second Development Decade, like the first, would be doomed to failure. In my judgement, this is one failure the United Nations cannot afford. We have reached a fateful juncture in our affairs. The phrase ""time is running out"" is no longer a figure of speech, but the literal truth.

I have described the 1970s as a dangerous decade because there is danger of international respect for human rights becoming unenforceable, of the poverty gap becoming unbridgeable, and of the nuclear arms race becoming uncontrollable.

Consider the gravity of our predicament.

In the matter of survival: with more devastating weapons of mass destruction being produced and no system of effective controls in sight, mankind is much closer to the brink of nuclear annihilation by accident, by miscalculation, by a lapse of intelligence or will, or by suicidal folly. Never in history has the survival of humanity hung on such a very thin thread.

In the matter of living space: population pressure is reducing drastically our room for manoeuvre in solving economic and social problems within nations and in the world at large. It threatens to impose unbreakable strains on the capacity of our planet to sustain human life in reasonable order, decency and dignity.

In the matter of bridging the poverty gap: this problem constitutes the most important long-term challenge to the United Nations.

As President McNamara of the World Bank has pointed out very recently:
""Two-thirds of mankindmore than 2,000 million individualsremain entrapped in the grip of hunger and malnutrition; high illiteracy, inadequate education; shrinking opportunity; and corrosive poverty. The gap between the rich and poor nations is no longer a gap, it is a chasm...""

""This appalling fact transcends in importance and gravity all other social and economic problems of this century. Much of world civilization for the future will be significantly influenced by how we manage this problem.""

He added population explosion to widespread poverty as another major factor in the grim equation of spiraling social unrest. He called attention to the social and political crisis which grows with each decade and threatens to round off this century with years of unrest and turbulence: a time of trouble during which the forces of historical change threaten to disintegrate our frail twentieth-century society.

This prophecy recalls our able Secretary-General's warning that we have only ten years in which to subordinate our ancient quarrels and launch a global partnership to curb the arms race, improve the human environment, defuse the population explosion, and supply the required momentum to world development.

It all adds up to a challenge of unprecedented magnitude to the United Nations and the world community. It is a challenge that could make or break our Organization. The United Nations will have to acquire the capacity to cope with the overriding problems of peace, international order and human survival or lapse into permanent ineptitude and insignificance.

Last May, a conference on human survival held here in the United Nations noted our dangerous drift towards chaos and disaster. The conferees refused to despairbut only if the United Nations were to be permitted to develop its full potential in meeting common dangers and common needs.

Full development of the United Nationsthat would indeed appear to be the only answer.

It would mean giving the United Nations adequate peace-keeping powers, sufficient authority to direct a concerted international effort to preserve our life-sustaining environment, and the means needed to implement a truly global development strategy. It would entail surrendering to the United Nations a larger measure of sovereignty than Member States have been willing to relinquish so far, and the acceptance by them of an allegiance to humanity superior to narrow racial or national loyalties.

For, indeed, if the human race is to survive, the human interest must be placed above the national interest, and the natural and essential agency for advancing the human interest is this, our United Nations.

It is admittedly a revolutionary concept, but I ask: will anything less suffice? It is what our threatened world needs and what the worlds troubled peoples, particularly the youth, are anxiously seeking and awaiting.

They want a peaceful world in which they can have a future unclouded by the threat of nuclear extinction. They want a new international order firmly founded on justice and law. And they want progress, not only for a select few but for all the members of the human family. That is what is expected of us, of this United Nations, if it is to survive."	1970-09-30
Carlos P. Romulo	UNGA 26	"Mr. President, your unanimous election to the presidency of this august body, on which I congratulate you most sincerely on behalf of the Government and people of the Philippines, was a proud moment for Asia. In your modest and unassuming person, the members of the General Assembly discerned and recognized the indomitable nationalist who fought heroically for Indonesian independence; the far-sighted Asian leader who is one of the architects of regional solidarity in our part of the world; the initiator of the Djakarta Conference in May 1970 on the peaceful solution of the Viet-Nam war; and the international statesman whose exceptional diplomatic skill helped to achieve a peaceful settlement of the West Irian dispute, enabled Indonesia to return to the United Nations with undiminished prestige, and contributed decisively to Indonesia's present economic rehabilitation with the understanding and co-operation of its major economic partners regardless of their differing ideologies.


Your predecessor, Edvard Hambro of Norway, who presided with admirable skill, perceptiveness and dedication over the historic twenty-fifth anniversary session of the General Assembly deserves our unstinting admiration and gratitude.


Mr. President, it is particularly appropriate that an eminent Asian should preside over this twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We have welcomed three new Members of the United Nations, Bhutan, Bahrain and Qatar, all from Asia. The Philippines has co-sponsored the admission of yet another Asian nation, Oman, whose equally welcome entry into the United Nations now brings the Organization's total membership to 131.


For the past quarter century the world has been in the throes of dynamic, revolutionary changes. The founding of the United Nations was an historic attempt to channel those changes along constructive lines. The history of the first quarter-century of the United Nations may thus be said to have consisted in essence of the fateful struggle to form a viable world community in the face of persisting, powerful and divisive national ambitionsin time to save mankind from the ultimate catastrophe of extinction. As our Secretary-General, U Thant, aptly pointed out during the commemorative meetings of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly last year:


""It is intolerable that the peoples of the world should have to live on the brink of disaster and that so many of them continue in a state of utter misery.... ""


""Thus it has been for the most part in the first twenty-five years of the United Nations. With some notable exceptions, Member Governments have, in practice, been more preoccupied with using the United Nations as an instrument to promote their own national policies than as a new kind of organization in which the nations of the world in co-operation could forge and execute solutions to world problems and work together for a better future.""


Unexpectedly, however, the second quarter-century of the United Nations has opened with a year of remarkable eventsevents that seem destined to affect favourably the course of world history for years to come. Most spectacular of these, of course, is the developing dtente in Asia. Here, as in other regions of the world, we are rapidly moving from an era of dangerous polarization to one of pluralization.


This new era of pluralization will certainly be marked by a multiplicity of interests and relationships and will carry with it great opportunities for harmonization and co-operative action. Relations will become interrelations, partly political, perhaps, but even more economic, cultural and educational in character. Not only Asia but the world community generally can expect to benefit from these important changes.


The remarkable initiative of President Nixon appears as the single event from which new possibilities must directly proceed. The first results have been both the complication and the clarification of the policies and intentions of nations in the region. The implementation of the ""Nixon Doctrine"", the clear enunciation of the policies of the People's Republic of China as, for instance, in the unprecedented interview given by Premier Chou En-lai to Mr. Reston of The New York Times; the intense and continuing policy discussions in Japan; the adjustments in the policies of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republicsall these point to realistic realignments among the four great Powers whose interests meet in Asia.


At the same time, ""pluralization"" means the opportunity for more creative participation in the affairs of the region by the smaller nations in joint, co-operative enterprises where their common interests meet, and for more independent initiative regarding their national interests. Speaking individually the voices of the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and others may not weigh heavily in the consideration of major decisions in Asia, but speaking with the collective voice of 300 million people, their roles and contributions must be more seriously regarded. It is against this background that the significance of joint efforts within regional organizations such as the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Asian and Pacific Council (ASPAC) should be assessed. Other effective and special-purpose regional groupings can be expected to emerge and play their part. The strengthening of economic and social co-operation is certain to occur and be increasingly looked upon with favour since it will offer real possibilities for solving economic problems which the individual Asian countries find it difficult or impossible to solve alone.


Interest in collective regional defence arrangements can be expected to decline. They have had their day. In their place may well develop collective political forums among the Asianssuch as the Asian Forum long proposed by H.E. President Ferdinand E. Marcos of the Philippinesfor the solution of political differences which may arise in the future. It is predictable also that the future will see on the part of the Asian nations an increased interest in and reliance on the United Nations. In this context, the keen and continuing concern of the Philippines to maximize the effectiveness of our world Organization will be more fully understood.

For the foreseeable future, it is plain that the paramount force in Asia is likely to remain nationalism. Nationalism is of two kinds. For the small developing Third World countries in Asia, nationalism is largely defensive in naturean attempt to maintain the conditions in which a viable nation can be created and sustained in the face of internal dissensions and the effects of external circumstances. Great Power nationalism is different in quality; it assumes international dimensions and greatly complicates relations between States big and small.

It is now evident that in Asia both types of nationalism are beginning to move toward more constructive expressions than have been the case in the past: the international nationalism of the large Powers is seeking accommodation, while the protective nationalism of the smaller Powers is seeking co-operative modes of expression for mutual benefit. In this connexion, I am refraining from discussing in this policy statement the question of Sabah because it is now a matter involving the highest level of both Governments concerned.

A new era of reality is opening before Asia. In this respect, the question of the representation of China in the United Nations is of the greatest importance to us Asians. In the past, the Philippines had taken a position against the seating of the Peoples Republic of China in the United Nations. The new realities have led the Philippines to reconsider its position.

Our position on this extremely important question is based four-square on the state-of-the-nation message delivered by President Marcos of the Philippines before the joint session of the Philippine Congress on 25 January this year. These were his perceptive and forthright words:

""Vast forces are at work in Asia today. Although the full implications of the new developments are not yet clear, they bolster my belief that a process of change is under way which will radically alter our traditional view of our part of the world.


""Accordingly, the principal aim of Philippine foreign policy in 1971 is to seek an accommodation with reality. Realism will be the hallmark of our foreign policy. The objectives are to augment and diversify relations with other countries, where we feel that such will promote the national interest; and to seek new friends while strengthening ties with old ones.


This policy statement of the head of State of the Philippines, made in January of 1971, some time before the dramatic announcement of President Nixon's intention to visit Peking, is the basis not only of Philippine efforts to normalize relations with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries of Eastern Europe, but also of our support for the entry of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations, without depriving the Republic of China of its own United Nations membership.


The Philippine position is based on the recognition of the fact that two Governmentsthe Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of Chinaclaim the right to represent the Chinese people or the Chinese State in the United Nations.


The reality of the situation has two aspects. It is an undeniable fact that, since the founding of the United Nations, the Republic of China has continuously represented China in this Organization. Year after year, the General Assembly has upheld this continuous representation of China by the Republic of China in all bodies of the United Nations, including the Security Council.


But it is also a fact that since 1949 the Government of the People's Republic of China has had effective control and authority over mainland China, while the Government of the Republic of China has had effective control and authority over other parts of the Chinese State, particularly Taiwan. Each has been accorded diplomatic recognition by an overwhelming number of nations. Recent statistics show that the Republic of China has diplomatic relations with 59 countries, 56 of which are States Members of the United Nations, while the People's Republic of China has diplomatic relations with 55 States Members of the United Nations.


These facts indicate why it has not been easy to reach a precise and clear-cut solution to this question, and why it has confounded this Assembly for the last two decades.


In this connexion I should like to recall that last year I stated for the record [1855th meeting (addendum)] that the Government and people of the Philippines have no desire to be in a posture of permanent opposition to the People's Republic of China. I expressed our sincere hope that our biggest neighbour in Asia would do everything in its power to merit membership of the United Nations on terms consonant with the provisions of its Charter.


I must emphasize this last point, namely, that the People's Republic of China should enter the United Nations on United Nations terms, not on terms which it apparently seeks to impose by proxy through its spokesmen in this Assembly. The People's Republic of China is a big Power, but it is not bigger than the United Nations, and it should not attempt to dictate the terms of its own entry into the United Nations even before the question has been decided by the General Assembly and the Security Council.

The Philippine delegation, in a spirit of frankness and objectivity with respect to the existing situation, believes that the fair, just and realistic solution would be for both the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China to be seated in the General Assembly and be eligible to become members of other bodies of the United Nations system.

But with respect to the permanent seat of China in the Security Council, my Government would be prepared to agree to its allocation to the People's Republic of China with its 750 million people, in recognition of the direct and logical relationship between permanent membership in the Council and the maintenance of international peace and security.

At the same time, the Philippine delegation will oppose any proposal that will, explicitly or by implication, result in the expulsion of the Republic of China from the United Nations. Expulsion, in our view, would be an act of injustice to a Government and people that have consistently shown sincere adherence to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. It would be unfair to a Government that has faithfully fulfilled its obligations under the Charter since the founding of the United Nations to be deprived of its legitimate seat in the Organization.

The Republic of China's population of some 14 million people is bigger than the populations of two-thirds of the Members of the United Nations. Moreover, the Republic of China has attained a noteworthy degree of economic progress and stability. These are facts too relevant and important to be overlooked. Consequently, my delegation will support the position that any proposal which would result in depriving the Republic of China of a seat in the United Nations is a question important enough to require a decision by a two-thirds vote of the General Assembly.

We feel that this Assembly simply cannot ignore the fact that the Republic of China, respecting the obligations of a Member nation, has not only represented China in the United Nations all these years but has also developed a separate social and economic system, with its own distinctive character, different from that on the Chinese mainland. And the clock cannot be turned back. What is history is fact.

Major steps towards accommodation and dtente have likewise occurred in other regions of the world since the twenty-fifth anniversary session of the General Assembly. We have witnessed a major breakthrough in the re-establishment of good relations in Central Europe, particularly between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. This development is due in considerable measure to the commendable courage and statesmanship of Chancellor Willy Brandt. It is our earnest hope, shared, we believe, by Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko of the Soviet Union among others, that the remaining difficulties will soon be overcome, thus paving the way for the entry into the United Nations of these two States at the earliest possible time and bringing yet nearer to realization our goal of universality. At the same time ways should be found to provide for the simultaneous entry into the United Nations of the other divided States, without prejudice to whatever arrangements they might later wish to make between themselves. And in this connexion, the retention by the Republic of China of its membership in the United Nations is most relevant. The expulsion of that country may close the door to the admission of divided States into the United Nations.

The completion of initial agreements at the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks in Helsinki, although these agreements are not yet of great consequence in themselves, and the commendation to this Assembly of a draft convention on biological weapons, even though it does not yet extend to chemical weapons, are other hopeful straws in the wind. While favourable winds are blowing, the international community should resolve to consolidate these gains with concrete undertakings and initiate new efforts in the areas of possible accommodation and consensus which are now open to us.

In this connexion it is vital to recall the new opportunities for enhancing the effectiveness of our United Nations. The recent reorientation of the United Nations Development Programme, the report of the Special Committee on the Rationalization of the Procedures and Organization of the General Assembly [A/8426], which we will shortly consider; the attention being given to the revitalization and enlargement of the Economic and Social Council; our review at this session of the role of the International Court of Justice [item 90]; and the report of the Committee for the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the United Nations [A/8425]; our agreement to consider during the twenty-seventh session the overdue review of the United Nations Charter [resolution 2697 (XXV)]; and the deepening concern for effective action to cope with the population explosion are all evidence of the recognition by Member States of the necessity for endowing the United Nations with the means to discharge more adequately the responsibilities entrusted to it in an era of accelerating interdependence and community of interest.

With regard to resolution 2697 (XXV) asking the Secretary-General to invite Member States to communicate their views and suggestions on the review of our Charter, the Government of the Philippines is preparing a detailed exposition of its views, as expressed at the twenty-fifth session, for circulation well before the twenty-seventh session. We trust that this subject will be given priority consideration by Member countries so that our discussion next year will prove as fruitful as possible.

Since the founding of the United Nations a major goal in the realization of international peace and security has been the achievement of safeguarded disarmament. Efforts in pursuit of this goal have been seriously handicapped by the absence from the disarmament negotiations of two of the nuclear PowersFrance and the People's Republic of China. Here again, new opportunities have opened up to us in recent months. An entrance to the disarmament negotiations for the two missing nuclear parties might well be provided by the proposal for a world disarmament conference [A/L.631]. It should be understood, however, that although such a conference might well serve several purposes, including that of a timely review of the progress made thus far towards disarmament, it could in no way take the place of the kind of detailed working out of specific problems that is now being done in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. Even if the results are not always up to expectations, the work of the Committee is characterized by a high degree of seriousness, commitment and competence. It may be necessary, however, to reconstitute the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in order to secure the participation of those additional countries which should be taking part in its deliberations.

A world disarmament conference would be a major step towards giving meaning and substance to the Disarmament Decade, now running concurrently with the Second United Nations Development Decade. In two years the Assembly has not succeeded in taking any other new initiative on a scale or of a content sufficient to justify the designation ""Disarmament Decade"", or adequately to emphasize the interdependence between a Disarmament Decade and the Second Development Decade. It will be recalled that the Government of the Philippines advanced some preliminary suggestions in this regard during the twenty-fifth General Assembly. We will return to these proposals at an appropriate time. 

Meanwhile, we would suggest that any world disarmament conference should either be held under the auspices of the United Nations or be organically related to it. Thought should be given to the activation, for this purpose, of the Disarmament Commission, that body of the whole which has not been utilized in recent years. The present new opportunities may make it possible, for the first time since the founding of the United Nations, to move beyond ""non-armament"" measures to measures providing for actual, concrete steps towards the reduction and destruction of armaments. Thus will begin the redeeming of a vital promise made to the world's peoples a quarter of a century ago.

Rather suddenly, the United Nations is faced with a number of new issues having global aspects beyond the possibility of resolution by the efforts of individual States alone. Foremost among these is the question of the deterioration of the human environment. Under the auspices of the Stanley Foundation, this important subject was discussed in depth at the Sixth Conference on the United Nations of the Next Decade, held at Sinaia, Romania, last June, by world statesmen, and a report on the conference proceedings was submitted to the Secretary-General. Nothing can serve to illustrate more vividly than the problems of environmental pollution the common destiny of mankind, the profound, global ramifications of local actions and the urgent need for a unified, integrated approach to economic and social development. Air and water are the first lifelines of spaceship Earth. If they are anywhere impaired, the total system is to that extent impaired. Most specific pollution problems can and must be dealt with locally, but that does not absolve the international community from the ultimate responsibility to see to it that they are resolved.

The time is past for mere lip-service in this vital matter. For instance, we continue to hear pious protestations of grave concern over the pollution of the human environment. Yet nuclear tests, with their concomitant danger of contaminating the air and the seas with their radioactive emissions, continue in disregard of the expressed wishes of the peoples affected. The Philippine Government has repeatedly protested the testing of nuclear weapons in the Pacific Ocean, which washes its eastern shores, but these protests have gone unheeded.

A second major subject of global scope concerns the utilization of the resources of the sea-bed beyond national jurisdictions as the common heritage of mankind and the elaboration of an international regime for that purpose.

My country, which is an archipelago, is vitally affected by this problem. In the course of the current general debate, some countries, particularly Iceland [1945th meeting] and Fiji [1951st meeting], referred to the question of archipelagos in connection with the conference on the law of the sea in 1973. My Government expects that in the forthcoming conference this problem, with other related issues, will be settled along the lines demanded by the progressive development and codification of international law affecting peace and stability in ocean space.

In his report, the Secretary-General calls our attention to the fact that to deal with such global issues it may be necessary, ""in the near future, to envisage new subsidiary organs or substantive departments in the United Nations"" [A/8401/Add.1, para. 911]. He correctly states that the creation of such new bodies ""should be viewed by the membership as an appropriate response to the ever new challenges of our world"" [ibid.].

Should we fail to endow the required efforts with the requisite resources or authority, then, of course, we shall have nobody but ourselves to blame if the unwanted conditions persist. Our hopes are high that the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, to be held at Stockholm in 1972, and the projected conference on the law of the sea will take the first major steps toward meeting the issues involved at the level and on the scale necessary to be effective.

Only a year ago this Assembly made an historic decision. It adopted for the first time an International Development Strategy which would serve as the programme of action for implementing the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. Today the international trade and monetary crisis, which is still unresolved, threatens to undermine that Strategy and casts a pall of uncertainty over the prospect of attaining the goals of the Development Decade itself.

By far the most deplorable aspect of this crisis is the plight of the developing countries. Innocent bystanders, with no role either in precipitating the crisis or in its solution, these poor countries stand to suffer the gravest injuries from its consequences.

The predicament of the developing countries has been recognized by the President of the World Bank Group, Mr. Robert S. McNamara. In the introduction to his address to the World Bank's Board of Governors on 27 September, he declaredand these are very important words:

""It is clear that we are in for a difficult period of basic readjustments in international monetary and trade arrangements and that the uncertainties may continue for some time. Although the solution of these problems is not the responsibility of the World Bank, we are deeply concerned with the manner of their resolution because of the impact it may have on the external trade of the developing countries, and on the resource flows to them.""

Mr. Pierre-Paul Schweitzer, Chairman of the Executive Board and Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, was even more explicit in his statement of the same date. He said: 

""I am particularly concerned about the impact of the current situation on the developing countries. Inflation and balance of payments difficulties in the industrial world... The present exchange rate uncertainties add a new and serious impediment to the development efforts of these countries, which also must contend with the effects of the U.S. import surcharge and the cuts in U.S. aid. All this is not an auspicious beginning for the Second Development Decade, when developing countries have the task of finding new avenues of productive employment for their growing populations.""

Both officials stressed the need to take into account the plight of the poor countries in the search for a solution to the international trade and monetary crisis.

Mr. McNamara said:

""Whatever steps are taken to improve the operation of the international monetary system must be such as to permit a continuing increase in capital flows to meet the targets to which the developed countries have subscribed:
an increase in public development assistance from $8 billion per year in 1970 to $12.5 billion in 1975.""

Mr. Schweitzer expressed the hope that the solution of the monetary crisis by the industrial countries would be followed ""by an increased willingness in these countries to maintain a steadily improving volume and quality of development assistance and to widen access to their markets.""[^8]

Such is the hope. But what is the reality? Mr. McNamara's own report contains the following sad and ominous admissions:

""The developing countries have justifiable grounds for complaint that they are being treated unfairly in their attempts to expand their manufactured exports to those markets [the markets of the richer countries]. On the average, tariffs are higher on the kinds of manufactured goods imported from poor countries as compared to imports from rich countries...
""Even worse than the absolute level of tariffs is their structure. Tariffs rise with the degree of fabrication... This... could well offset the comparative advantages in processing found in many developing countries,""

He continued:

""Finally, and perhaps worst of all, non-tariff barriers to trade have proliferated throughout the rich countries in recent years... They too are more severe for developing countries.""

In other words, the promotion of economic diversification, of a fair and rational international division of labour, and of the progressive industrialization of the developing countries, goals which are accepted in principle in the United Nations, are in fact being impeded if not actually negated in practice.

Nor is the sombre situation limited to manufactures. The Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization, Dr. Boerma, has called attention to what he has described as the ""completely unbalanced"" state of world agriculture, warning that if this condition is allowed to persist, it might provoke intensified trade war.

There is something fundamentally wrong in an international economic order under which such things can happen. The Philippine delegation feels that the time has come for the United Nations to discharge fully its duties under paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 1 of the Charter with respect to international co-operation in the economic and social fields. It should henceforth be one of its urgent major concerns to help devise means of protecting the poor countries from the adverse effects of international monetary and trade crises concerning which these poor countries have little or no say but which could ruin them financially or set back their development efforts for years with disastrous economic and social consequences for their peoples. We must arrest the present accelerating drift towards a new age of domination based on economic advantage.

In other major fields of United Nations concern, the glaring discrepancies between principle and practice, between the felt needs of the international community and the limited action permitted by national ambitions and interests, are also apparent.

Despite the welcome signs of growing detente in Europe, to which I have referred, peace in the Middle East continues to hang by the thread of a cease-fire tenuously maintained amidst a mutual escalation of armaments.

In this International Year for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, no substantial progress has been achieved in the struggle against apartheid. Meanwhile, the flow of trade and investments, as well as the supply of arms, that sustain the practitioners of apartheid continue, hardly abated by United Nations sanctions against that universally condemned policy. Remnants of classical colonialism, which is also a form of racial oppression, likewise continue to exist in its last strongholds, particularly in Africa, in defiance of the United Nations Charter and of the repeatedly expressed will of the international community.

Every year, references are made to the need for stronger support for the United Nations. Yet this same Organization has been permitted to reach the brink of financial bankruptcy. One major Power concerned has announced that it will contribute an ""important"" sum to help cover past United Nations financial deficiencies; other Powers equally concerned, however, have remained silent.

The present international trade and monetary crisis has simply dramatized the central dilemma that has afflicted the United Nations since its inception. The Member States, particularly the great Powers with the special responsibilities inherent in their status as permanent members of the Security Council, have never quite accepted the requirement, implicit in the Charter, to subordinate narrow national interests to the general well-being of mankind, oras last year's Conference on Human Survival so aptly put itto recognize that ""human sovereignty transcends national sovereignty"".

In moving from the era of frozen polarization into a new period of pluralization, it is essential to accept that the first requirement is for a flexible common instrument through which that pluralization can be constructively and creatively expressed. But although that instrument already exists in the United Nations, its full utility as the focal point for forging collective decisions has yet to be realized. ""Foreign policy"" in this sense is becoming obsolete.

Nations now hold collective responsibility for non-divisible world. The policy-making emphasis will be more and more toward joint problem-solving for planetary development and management. Only in such a context can the security and freedom of nations and peoples be assured and the great promise of our earth for the well-being of mankind be realized.

And now permit me to conclude my statement with three expressions of well-deserved tribute. The first is to Mr. Paul Hoffman, the exceptionally able Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), who is about to retire after some 12 years of devoted service to the cause of that indispensable component of lasting peace: economic and social development. Under Mr. Hoffman's inspired and dedicated leadership, UNDP has become the largest operational agency of the United Nations in the field of development with good prospects of doubling its operational funds to $500 million by 1975.

This impressive progress has been achieved through far-sighted planning, sound operational methods, including the application of pre-investment aid in the vital sectors of national development programmes, and effective response to the keenly felt needs of the developing nations. The United Nations owes Mr. Hoffman an inestimable debt of gratitude for his work in building up UNDP to its present size and its enhanced potential for service towards the accelerated development of the poor countries.

My second tr"	1971-10-08
Carlos P. Romulo	UNGA 27	"General debates have traditionally been occasions for stock-taking, for reflecting upon the state of the world and of the United Nations, and for giving voice at this universal forum to the needs and aspirations of mankind. As we approach the end of this particular general debate, we find the balance sheet a sobering blend of hope and concern.


The two super-Powers have taken an important step to control the nuclear armaments race by agreeing to quantitative limits on strategic nuclear weapons. Yet their competition for qualitative supremacy in nuclear weaponry continues, precluding substantial reductions in their armament budgets. And while expectations of progress towards disarmament are prominently projected, there is a significant silence on the use of the immense savings that would accrue from disarmament.


The great hope of the poor countries, repeatedly expressed in this Assembly over the years, that a substantial part of savings from disarmament should be committed to development aid thus remains a remote, if not indeed an illusory, hope. The link which the developing countries have sought to establish between the two major undertakings of the United Nations in the 1970sthe Disarmament Decade and the Second Development Decaderemains tenuous at best.


The welcome dtente in Europe has undoubtedly reduced international tensions on that continent, one which has the dubious distinction of having produced two world wars and still has the potential to ignite a third one in this century. Yet nuclear proliferation continues in Europe, and one of Europe's leading countries has persisted in conducting nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific Ocean in disregard of the United Nations ban on nuclear testing in the atmosphere and under water and in defiance of world public opinion and the indignant protests of the countries in the area, which rightly argue that, if such nuclear tests are as harmless as they are claimed to be, there is no reason not to conduct them in the Atlantic Ocean, or for that matter, off the famous Riviera, where they might serve as an additional tourist attraction.


Next door, in the Middle East, not only has peace remained out of reach but the jockeying among the great Powers for positions of advantage and influence in the continuing crisis has not abated. Nor have the sales and supplies of arms to the combatant countries been stopped. This is a factor worth pondering in connexion with the proposal, laudable in its avowed purpose, for the non-use of force in international disputes. Does this proposal simply mean that the great Powers should refrain from attacking one another directly? Should it not, rather, be carried a step further and taken to mean that the great Powers should not abet the use of force by lesser Powers through the convenient device of selling or supplying arms to them? In other words, is it not about time that the great Powers, unable to attack one another directly without mortal danger to themselves, ceased to practise wars by proxy, by using the third world as a cockpit for their persisting ambitions for regional or global hegemony?


We have noted the developing dtente in Europe, but what of other regionspeace being all the more indivisible now in our ever more tightly interdependent world?


Latin America is in the throes of a social revolution which is unfolding within the framework of its deeply ingrained sense of solidarity, its cherished traditions of justice and responsible order and its strong desire to make its full contribution to international peace and well-being.


Africa continues its uncompromising struggle against apartheid and other forms of racial discrimination, hand in hand with its struggle, no less uncompromising, against the remaining strongholds of colonialism. These are struggles to which the Philippines, with its own experience of nearly four centuries of colonialism and of exploitation by foreign Powers, cannot remain indifferent; indeed we have time and again manifested our solidarity with our African friends on these fundamental issues, which touch the very heart of the United Nations Charter.


What of our own region of Asia? In Asia, too, signs of detente have been detected. An auspicious beginning has been made towards a peace settlement between India and Pakistan. Bangladesh has been recognized as an independent nation by many countries, although, regrettably, it has not yet been admitted into the United Nations. South Korea and North Korea are embarked on a fateful dialogue that could conceivably lead to the agreed and peaceful reunification ardently desired by the Korean people. China and Japan have reached agreement on the establishment of diplomatic relations, a step of far-reaching significance. But the tragic war in Indo-China continues, with no just end as yet clearly in sight. Great Power moves to fill expected vacuums of power in the Asian region persist. There is no assurance that Asia can soon achieve the conditions of peace and stability which it so sorely needs and which found poignant expression last year in the Declaration issued at Kuala Lumpur by the Foreign Ministers of the countries members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN]Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailandthat their countries were determined to exert initially necessary efforts to secure the recognition of and respect for South-East Asia as a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality, free from any form or manner of interference by outside Powers.


In the last several years the Philippines has increasingly emphasized its participation in regional groups organized in accordance with the Charter, most notably in the sphere of economic, social and cultural co-operation. There have been significant shifts in orientation in the two most important regional groupings of which we are a member. In the Asian and Pacific Council there is fresh emphasis on economic development, brought about by new developments in Asia, principally by the developing detente and the consequent realignment of forces in the area. In ASEAN, more decisive initiatives are being undertaken to promote closer regional collaboration. Early this year ASEAN took a giant step forward in its co-operative endeavours. It approved a plan for the liberalization of trade on a selective basis and another plan for industrial complementation on a similar selective basis.


Heretofore ASEAN had been a collection of separate co-operative endeavours. Although these areas of co-operation wereand areimportant in themselves and have proved a great practical benefit to the region in such diverse fields as the development of tourism, the utilization of available technology and cultural exchanges, the economic agreement recently concluded is bound to be regarded as the hub of ASEAN activities. It is perhaps sanguine to speak of a common market in connexion with South-East Asia at this point in time, but the complementation plan drafted with the help of the United Nations may correctly be viewed as the fore-runner of an important scheme for regional economic integration. If it succeeds, it will doubtless become a landmark in Asian economic co-operation and it will have its particular contribution to make to the world economic situation.


The five member countries rely on ASEAN and will do so in the future to a degree which none of them had anticipated. Unless the international economic situation improves markedly for the developing countries, the members of ASEAN will feel increasingly that the maximum opportunities for co-operation with the rest of the world could best be achieved through regional rather than individual national efforts. Looking towards this possibility, ASEAN has begun exploratory conversations with the European Economic Community with the objective of improving the deteriorating market for its export commodities.


Thus, ASEAN is proof that the habit of co-operation can be fruitfully developed, even among countries with diverse traditional backgrounds. Less than six years after its founding, ASEAN is beginning to develop a personality of its own and to exert a modest force in Asian affairs. A few years ago the Foreign Ministers of the ASEAN countries agreed to try to help in mediating the Cambodian conflict. This year the same Foreign Ministers, in a move expressive of their deep concern over the war in Viet-Nam, proposed a formula which the parties to the conflict could consider as a means of breaking the impasse in current negotiations. We shall do so again, taking into account the objections voiced by the parties principally concerned, in the belief that the Asian voice is not irrelevant in a war being fought on Asian soil which causes a grievous toll in Asian lives.


The modest achievements of ASEAN are a source of pride to its member countries, which regard them as reassuring auguries of more important future accomplishments; ASEANs progress could be enhanced and accelerated in the hoped-for climate of peace and stability for Asia to which I have referred.


Modest innovations recently undertaken by the United Nations have, in the view of my Government, been worthwhile. We are referring specifically to the reinstitution of periodic meetings of the Security Council and to the meetings of the Council held in Africa. Occasional such meetings in various parts of the globe can help to highlight and bring new efforts to bear on the problems of the region. In this connexion, the Philippine Government suggests that the Security Council should give consideration to a meeting in the near future in Asia. Asia is in a state of flux and change, and yet at the very time when there is so much new promise in Asian affairs the region remains beset by enormous problems. The effort to come to grips with both the difficulties and the new opportunities could be raised to a new level, where new perspectives could be brought to bear, in our view, by a meeting of the Security Council in Asia.


Peace and non-interference by outside Powersthese are two of the things beyond price which the developing countries of Asia need today: peace, because in the absence of the danger of aggression we can devote more of our resources to the pressing task of development to fulfil our peoples just desire for a better life; non-interference by outside Powers, because externally inspired and supported subversion is still one of the most serious problems confronting the developing countries in Asia.


In the Philippines this particular problem reached a state of extreme gravity last month and impelled President Marcos to invoke the authority vested in him by the Philippine Constitution to proclaim martial law. The Presidents immediate purpose was to safeguard the Republic of the Philippines from violent overthrow by subversive groups operating with external support. But he has also seized the opportunity to set in train urgently needed measures to eliminate the inequities in Philippine society by means of a thorough reform and restructuring of social, political and economic institutions that had not been sufficiently responsive to the urgent need for social justice. Significantly, one of the very first decisions was to declare the entire Philippines a land-reform area.


The seriousness of the Philippine situation was aggravated by the occurrence last July of the worst flood disaster in Philippine history. Over an area in which the average rainfall was 100 inches, 75 inches of rain fell in one single week, and the rainfall lasted for three weeks, flooding almost the entire vast fertile central plain of Luzon, which is known as the rice bowl or rice granary of the Philippines. Highly productive rice farms, sugar land, fish ponds, houses, infrastructures and industrial complexeseven the metes and bounds of private propertywere obliterated or damaged to an extent which may set back our development efforts for three to five years. The flood victims numbered more than 2 million persons out of the disaster areas total population of 7 million; but statistical figures alone cannot really measure the immensity of the human cost of the calamity.


It was in the wake of the widespread material devastation and human suffering caused by that unprecedented flood disaster that the subversive groups in the Philippines intensified their attempts to sow panic and undermine the conditions of law and order indispensable to effective reconstruction work, leaving President Marcos no alternative but to declare martial law.


At this point, I should like to place on record the profound gratitude of the Government and people of the Philippines for the assistance given to the flood disaster victims which we received from all quartersand not only from Governments with which we have diplomatic relations, but also from countries with which we have not as yet established such relations, such as the Peoples Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, both of which gave us generous and welcome assistance.


The International Red Cross and its affiliates, true to an old and honored tradition, responded immediately with emergency aid. So did the United Nations Childrens Fund [UNICEF] with its ready supplies, its action-oriented approach, and its wealth of experience in coping with emergency situations. The World Food Programme, the Economic and Social Council, the World Health Organization and the United Nations Development Programme [UNDP] also rose admirably to the occasion, and the United Nations Disaster Relief Co-ordinator, Ambassador Farouk Berkol, faced with his first major challenge, acquitted himself in commendable fashion and vindicated the wisdom of the Assembly in establishing his Office last year. The Secretariat staff and many individual contributors, in a spontaneous gesture of sympathy, collected a substantial contribution, which the Secretary-General himself transmitted to the Philippine National Red Cross through the Philippine Mission to the United Nations.


I have referred in some detail to the various United Nations agencies that extended assistance to the Philippines in its hour of need, because it illustrates the great constructive potential of the United Nations in assisting countries to cope with natural disasters. The Philippine delegation hopes to enhance this potential with a new proposal, following up the initiative it took at the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly on the role of the World Meteorological Organization [WMO] in discovering ways and means to mitigate the harmful effects of  storms and remove or minimize their destructive potentials. Our new proposal will take the form of a draft resolution entitled International action on the mitigation of the harmful effects of storms. Its principal aim will be to bring about integrated action through increased co-operation and co-ordination among the WMO, the UNDP and the United Nations Disaster Relief Co-ordinator in the field of United Nations natural disaster assistance, particularly the prevention, prediction and control of natural disasters.


We hope that this Philippine proposal will attract a good number of other sponsors and that it will merit the unanimous approval of this Assembly.


Terrorism is on our agenda [item 92], and rightly so. Criminal acts of individuals or groups of individuals against the innocent can never be condoned by the international society, and every possible resource must be mobilized to end and prevent them. Thus, it will be remembered, the Philippine delegation last year exerted itself particularly in the effort to develop effective means to end the hijacking of aircraft, and the Republic of the Philippines is at present taking extraordinary measures to meet similar threats at home. To the extent that acts of terrorism are irrational and aberrant reactions to unresolved international differences, they should in no way be excused, and must be condemned. But we must at the same time accept the responsibility of renewing our efforts to solve these disputes. We cannot claim to be blameless until we have exerted ourselves to the utmost to solve these disputes.


The United Nations, of course, has an immense potential for constructive work in every field of international activity, and it is one of the most lamentable facts of our time that this potential has never been fully used. The great Powers have never given to the United Nations the full measure of faith and support which it needs and deserves in order to attain the great goals of the Charter. During this general debate this Assembly hall has resounded again and again with commendatory references to vital prospects of detente, historic summit meetings, bold initiatives to inaugurate an era of negotiation in lieu of confrontation, and actual agreements on nuclear weapons control. And all of these, sad to admit, have come to pass outside the United Nations auspices. When it should be playing a central role in the efforts to achieve one of the primary aims of the Charter, the United Nations has been shunted off to the periphery of major developments in the field of international security.


A great opportunity was missed in the first year of the United Nations, when the great Powers failed to unite in support of the Charter's aims to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained. They indulged, instead, in the dangerous and sterile cold war.


What a vastly different world we would now have if the great Powers had channelled even a modest portion of the immense resources which they expended on the cold war to the United Nations in order to achieve the Charter's aim to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom, thereby giving substance to the other primary aim of the Charter: to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small.


Is it still possible for the United Nations to have a second chance to fulfil its function of effectively helping to achieve the goals of the Charter? The latest report of the President of the World Bank Group, Mr. Robert McNamara, suggests that it is almost too late. In his address to the recently concluded meeting of the World Bank Group he saidand members of this Assembly should listen carefully to his words:


With the [Official Development Assistance] only half achieved, the poorer nations have almost no hope of attaining the 6 per cent growth target. That will condemn them to so slow an economic advance over the decade that hundreds of millions of individuals within these countries will be able to detect virtually no improvement whatever in their desperately low standards of living. Their per capita incomes will rise by no more than two dollars a year.  


Those are the words of Mr. McNamara. I quote him again:


	""Projected to the end of the century  only a generation away  that means the people of the developed countries will be enjoying per capita incomes, in 1972 prices, of over $8,000 a year, while these masses of the poor ... will on average receive less than $200 per capita, and some 800 million will receive less than $100.""

In other words, the infamous poverty gap is widening at an accelerated rate and the poor, developing countries are in fact on the verge of living in a global ghetto, with all the ominous implications of such a situation, one of which the President of the World Bank spells out in these fateful words:

""If the rich nations do not act  through both aid and trade  to diminish the widening imbalance between their own collective wealth and the aggregate poverty of the poor nations, development simply cannot succeed within any acceptable time frame. The community of nations will only become more dangerously fragmented into the privileged and the deprived, the self-satisfied and the frustrated, the complacent and the bitter. It will not be an international atmosphere conducive to tranquility.""

And Mr. McNamara emphasizes: ""The developed nations, then, must do more to promote at least minimal equity in the distribution of wealth among nations.""

In this context the decline in international co-operation for development has ominous implications not only for the prosperity but also for the prospects of a stable and enduring peace in the world. The decrease, actual and proposed, in the budgetary support of some countries for the United Nations and its family of agencies is discouraging enough. But even more disheartening is the prospect that voluntary contributions of some affluent countries to such vital United Nations agencies as UNICEF and the UNDP may either stagnate or also be reduced.


As one of the founding fathers of the United Nations, I sincerely hope that these apprehensions will prove to be groundless. All the great new issues developing in the United Nations underline the undeniable oneness of the human family, the inseparable unity of mankind's destiny on this fragile, finite and vulnerable planet earth.


The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm in June, which achieved great success despite the formidable difficulties it had to overcome, brought home the sobering fact that we have only one earth and that we must act as one community to safeguard and nourish its life-support systems.


The declaration by the Secretary-General on 20 September 1972 that 1974 will be observed as World Population Year is a cogent reminder that the earth's resources are limited and that population planning is indispensable to the preservation of the human species and the enhancement of the quality of life in the world. The Philippine delegation is gratified at the outstanding success of the United Nations Fund for Population Activities in effectively conveying this message and is prepared to give its full support to the World Population Year's programme.


The preparatory meetings for the forthcoming conference on the law of the sea pointedly remind us that sea and ocean resources beyond the limits of national jurisdiction are part of the common heritage of mankind.


The imperatives of preserving human life and enhancing its quality in a relatively small, crowded earth with finite resources are pushing us inexorably to consider seriously the necessity of subordinating narrow nationalistic self-interest to the larger requirements of mankind. The United Nations is an indispensable instrument in this inherently difficult, perhaps slow, and certainly painful, transition.


The United Nations is here; it is ready and eager to serve; and it is at our disposal. Let us give it a second chance to play the central role in international affairs that the Charter intended for it. As we have repeatedly proposed, let us amend the Charter, if possible, in order to make the United Nations more effective and more responsive to the needs and the problems of today. It is axiomatic that the General Assembly provides the opportunity only for the most general assessment. The kind of deliberate consideration required by a change in the Charter can only take place in a proper body constituted for that purpose. The Government of the Philippines is ready to join in recommending that a proper forum be established by the Assembly for a careful consideration of those specific suggestions which have been made or will be made in more detail by Member Governments and qualified experts. A small but broadly representative body would sift in orderly fashion the various suggestions put forward and develop a picture of the range of agreement which exists. Those suggestions commanding broad support would be acted upon in due time by two major deliberative organs of the United Nations.


Support for a considered examination of the world Organization's Charter and an evaluation of its effectiveness in meeting the new challenges of today has come from widely diverse quartersfrom Member States large and small. There is a widespread commitment to examine with care whatever specific proposals may be advanced. This is true, for instance, of the reply of the United States [A/8746/Add.1], a major founding Member, and also true of the vigorous statement made here in this Assembly by the People's Republic of China [2051st meeting], which is the newest major Member of our Organization to assume its seat.


In the meantime, let us make full use of the United Nations as it is and give it our complete support. Now is a propitious time to begin. We have an energetic, perceptive, resourceful President of the General Assembly, who has already shown himself to be worthy of the example set by his most distinguished predecessors, the latest being the eminent Indonesian statesman, Foreign Minister Adam Malik.


And as the successor of our highly esteemed former Secretary-General U Thant, whose sterling worth is indicated by his success in holding the most impossible job in the world for over 10 years, we are most fortunate in having Mr. Kurt Waldheim, a man of outstanding vision, integrity and moral courage. Mr. Waldheim is that rare combination of a man of wisdom and a man of actiona Secretary-General who is not afraid to take initiatives, to offer his good offices, to practise quiet diplomacy or to speak out clearly and frankly when in his judgement his duties under the Charter require him to do so. He has our full confidence and support.


To sum up our general debate, each year as we gather here to review the problems and the prospects in international affairs, we cannot help being struck by how radically our world has changed in one years time. What was seen as tentative and problematical in one year has become the immediate reality of the next. A year ago we were preparing for the conference on the environment in Stockholm. Today, following the enormous success of that conference, we have a new and deeper appreciation of the individuality of the earths biospherethat thin envelope that alone supports life, not just human life but all life. We have acquired in one short year a more profound understanding of our fundamental interdependence.


In the political realm, in the relations between nations, we have witnessed a no less astounding and vital leap forward toward accommodationan accommodation which, again, has the same roots, conscious or not, in a growing awareness of the essentiality of the interdependence of man if we are to have a viable future at all.


Each of these vital issues seems to illustrate once again how we are moving into an era of collective responsibility for the globe and its peoples. While maintaining the rich cultural heritage and unique individuality of nations and races, we must by conscious effort surmount the narrow parochialism of unilateral national action whenever it impinges on the well-being of the world as a whole. It is in this light that my Government chooses to view each action taken by our world Organization, holding the firm conviction that with each step will come the insight that will guide us yet further in the harmonization of human affairs."	1972-10-09
Carlos P. Romulo	UNGA 28	"Mr. President, fellow travellers on Spaceship Earth: it is with pleasure that the Philippine delegation offers its warm congratulations to you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Your many years of distinguished participation in the affairs of the United Nations is the best guarantee that you will guide this Assembly successfully. We are certain that under your able leadership our deliberations will proceed expeditiously and productively, and that we will maintain the high standard of achievement of your eminent predecessors, the latest of whom was the distinguished Deputy Foreign Minister of Poland, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczy?ski.


A time of change, such as the present, should be a time of opportunity. When human affairs become fluid, what has been impossible becomes possible. What could never be attempted can be accomplished. On the other hand, when old moorings are swept away and old approaches and patterns no longer work, a sense of disorientation and anxiety can overcome us. The question is how we meet change. If we utilize change, direct change, steer change into constructive channels, we can transform situations that have been intractable and we can build anew in better, more adequate ways. If we resist change, if we mourn the old ways, if we are unprepared and have no designs for a better future, then the tides of change will be blocked and futility and frustration will be the result.


That we are at such a ""fork in history"" is plain to all of us. Every field of human affairs is characterized by rapid and irreversible change. The wise guiding of change is our major responsibility as we near the three-quarter mark of this century.


Even forms of government yield to change and adapt to the overriding needs and aspirations of peoples, aspirations whose fulfilment cannot any longer be delayed. Where there is no change, or where efforts are made to set the clock back, disaster is the result. Thus, in the Philippines, as in many other countries, change has become necessary and inevitable in response to the nation's imperative need for a better life.


At a time when many old, historically stable, democratic Governments are finding the traditional processes of democracy tarnishedI repeat, tarnishedand their stability uncertain, even more the Governments of newer and poorer nations are discerning, as the Philippines has discerned, that decisive and innovative changes are called for.


A year ago, President Ferdinand E. Marcos of the Philippines established what was aptly described as a New Society. In essence it was a realistic response to a compelling need for revolutionary change. The old political framework, transplanted from the West, had proved inadequate to satisfy the aspirations of our people for economic and social justice. Structural reforms were needed; indeed, the entire society had to be restructured. The paramount aim was full participation of the people in the responsibilities, as well as the benefits, of national development.


President Marcos said on the occasion of the first anniversary of the New Society two weeks ago:


""Basically, what we have done was to lay the foundations of national civility that have been torn up by decades of bitter political strife and social anarchy. We have redressed the most urgent popular grievances. We have established a pattern of social, political and economic stability. From this new level of stability we must now launch our nation towards new heights of development.""


The results are indeed noteworthy. Due to enhanced international acceptance, arising from greatly improved domestic stability, peace and order, foreign investments in the Philippines increased by 138 per centI repeat, 138 per cent. The growth of domestic business has kept pace.


Even more significant is the change brought about by land reform, the historic cause of social unrest. In recognition of its importance, the first act of President Marcos under the New Society was to declare the entire country a land reform area. In just one year more than 100,000 land transfers have been accomplished, together with essential supporting measures such as the establishment of cooperatives and credit financing, and the development of farm infrastructure facilities. This exceeds the total number of transfers in the quarter century since the Philippines regained its independence.


The six-year land reform programme envisions the transfer of more than 1.5 million hectares of farm land to nearly 1 million tenant farmers.


Another significant change for the better is the increase of foreign exchange reserves. Starting at a very low point, our foreign exchange reserves rose by over 5,000 per centI repeat, 5,000 per centunder the New Society. In 1972, the surplus was near rock bottom at $10 million. During the first eight months of 1973 it went up to $531 million, and in September it rose to $759 million as against $10 million a year ago. There has also been a notable improvement in the balance-of-payments position, which in the past year showed a surplus of $425 million as against only $6 million the previous year.

Tax revenues have increased by more than 65 per cent, reflecting the effectiveness of tax reforms and, more important, enhanced popular support for the New Society. Tourists are coming in ever-greater numbers, and a 30 per cent increase is projected for the coming year.

The economic gains under the New Society are matched by advances in the social sectors. Every aspect of national development has received a fresh impetus. The New Society has acted as a catalyst, releasing the creative energies of our people. Dynamic self-help is being maximized.

In this great undertaking of transforming a society that had been stunted and malformed by centuries of foreign domination, we have received invaluable assistance from friendly countries and various agencies of the United Nations family. Almost by definition, poor, developing countries, particularly former colonies like the Philippines, cannot attain self-sustaining growth by self-help alone. There are critical gaps in technology, modern equipment and capital funds that can only be filled with external aid.

We are particularly grateful to the United Nations Development Programme [UNDP], now the largest United Nations operational agency for development, for envisaging an increased indicative planning figure allocation in support of our four-year country development programme. The programme is being reviewed in the light of the New Society's development priorities. We intend to maintain close co-operation with UNDP in this exercise.

On the social side, the United Nations Children's Fund [UNICEF] continues to give us urgently needed aid, particularly in the vital fields of child health, applied nutrition, and education for under-privileged youth. Important and deeply appreciated technical assistance is being provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Labour Organisation, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and other specialized agencies.

But the greatest share of credit and responsibility belongs to our own people, who are now energetically working in unison under the inspired leadership of our President. The most important gain [of the New Society], said President Marcos, is the transformation of our people. It is here that our Democratic Revolution [finds] its greatest virtue.


We are responding constructively to the challenge of change. Politically and economically we are striving, with growing success, to put our own house in order. But in our interdependent world there can be no security in isolation.


Our foreign policy therefore has also undergone significant change under the New Society. Among these is a new and sustained effort to open the windows towards the socialist and/or communist countries. Last year, the Philippines established diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia and Romania. And in the last two weeks, diplomatic ties were forged between the Philippines and the German Democratic Republic, the Polish Peoples Republic and the Hungarian Peoples Republic, respectively. Active negotiations are in progress to normalize relations with other socialist countries.


It is also natural that we should be deeply concerned about the situation in our own neighbourhood, in the Asian region to which we belong.


With the ending of the war in Viet-Nam, a new situation confronts us in Asia. One super-Power, the United States, is withdrawing its forces from the Asian mainland and generally reducing its military presence in the area. Another super-Power, the Soviet Union, is increasing its political and military presence in the region. Then we have China, historically and actually the most important Asian country. And modern Japan represents an unprecedented, perhaps unique, factor in the sense that it is a great economic power which thus far has renounced the traditional attendant trappings of military power.


The crucial question for us in Asia is this, What shape or form will this momentous convergence of events and forces assume? Will the change be constructive? Or will a new struggle for domination turn Asia once again into a battleground of competing great Power ambitions?


In Kuala Lumpur on 27 November 1971, the member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN]Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailandhave adopted the ASEAN Declaration of South-East Asia as a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality. This Declaration expresses their desire to see peace and stability prevail in Southeast Asia and indeed in the whole Asian region, through the observance of the principle of non-intervention in their domestic affairs. It is supplemented by President Marcoss proposal for an Asian forum in which Asian problems could be considered in a spirit of amicable co-operation and Asian disputes settled by peaceful means.


Still a cause for serious concern is the continued fighting in Cambodia. Foreign interference is fanning the fires of conflict between the two contending national leaderships in the Khmer Republic. But however plausible the reasons may be, intervention in the internal affairs of a State is inadmissible. We believe therefore that the basic prescription for peace in Cambodia will be to allow the Cambodians to decide their own destiny without active and material assistance from outside. It is up to the Khmer people themselves to determine unmolested the leadership and Government of their choice. If it was possible in Laos to achieve a peace settlement among the contending parties, it is reasonable to expect that a similar accord could be reached in Cambodia. The adjudication of differences within nations and among peoples of the same race, of the same culture and tradition, if left alone, should be easier to accomplish. Another aspect of the Khmer conflict is the claim put forward that the government in exile had remote control of that territory when it took flight. The United Nations should reject this claim as it is incredible and also fraught with dangerous implications for every Member State.


The ASEAN countries were heartened by the Shanghai communique of 27 February 1972, in which China and the United States agreed that no single Power should exercise hegemony in Asia. They are encouraged by the professed desire of Japan to play a constructive role in the peaceful development of the Asian region and they hope that the Soviet Union, in developing its policies and its presence in Asia, will take fully into account the Asian peoples aspiration to peaceful progress.


While Asia claims our primary interest, we are no less concerned with the state of the world as a whole. In this larger context, change is also the order of the day. And so it must be with our own world Organization. The United Nations cannot afford to stand still. It must move resolutely toward the future in a sustained effort to bring into being a peaceful and equitable world motivated by justice and humanity. Building the future can be, and should be, a joyful process of co-operative construction. But if change is resisted, if nations are grudging in participating in the communal task, if they refuse to see the handwriting on the wall, then humanity will shed many more bitter and wholly unnecessary tears.


Our skills are not so lacking, our understanding is not so meagre, that Spaceship Earth cannot be managed, cannot be piloted successfully toward a better future. No, the ingenuity and imagination of men, the knowledge and wisdom we already have in hand are not so deficient that we can find an excuse in ignorance or a refuge in lack of vision, or in a failure to meet the urgent requirements of our times. The blame, if blame there is to be, must lie in the spirit of separatism and of insularity and in efforts to maintain the status quo rather than in exploring together and planning together for that future toward which we are inevitably travelling and in which we shall find that our common identity is the only workable, the only practical and the only functional reality.


There can be no secession from the world. No nation can return to former, less complicated, less interdependent days. Instead, the implications of our new interdependence have to be spelled out and must, for survivals sake, be implemented without delay.


In many ways our world Organization has demonstrated remarkable adaptability, innovation and originality. In the passage of time, it has generated global departments for many of humanitys most urgent needs: among others, in the fields of health, food, education, economic assistance, atomic energy and, even more recently, in environment, population and soon, we hope, a regime for the sea-bed and ocean space. It can be said without exaggeration that these departments of planetary management are fundamentally sound, if inadequately supported. Considering the restrictions on their activities imposed by limited resources, they have to their credit many significant achievements.


Clearly, however, the United Nations is not yet receiving the support or the recognition of its centrality in the affairs of all its Members which is required for successful, joint, co-operative approaches to mans most pressing problemsproblems which cannot be met and mastered except at the global level. The near-universality of the Organization, and the new steps achieved at the beginning of this session, suggest a growing realization of the essential and fundamental role the Organization will be required to play in the future.


I should like, at this time, in my turn to offer my congratulations and the warm welcome of my country to the three new Members of our Organization: the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. We look forward to the important contribution which we are sure they will make to the work of the United Nations. The roster is now nearly complete, and we look forward to the membership of the remaining divided countries at the earliest possible time.


We have already heard in this general debate several references to the encumbrances of an Organization which has not changed as rapidly as it should, which continues to be handicapped in its work by improvisation, ad hoc inventions and last-minute efforts to head off major disasters, a tactic which is foredoomed to failure. It is perfectly true that improving the structure and functioning of our Organization will not mean that it will automatically be used more effectively by its Members. At the same time, however, every improvement we make will remove one more excuse for the non-use of the United Nations.


Improvements in our pre-atomic-age Charter have been long, almost disastrously, delayed. The structure of the Security Council no longer accords with reality. It should be enlarged and made more truly representative. The human rights functions of the Organization seriously need rationalization and centralization. There is no standing machinery for conciliation in political disputes. The peace-keeping machinery is still ad hoc in character. We have heard earlier that it may now be possible to move ahead, finally, in the institutionalization of the peace-keeping function which is vital and indispensable to world peace. Our earnest hope is that renewed efforts will bear fruit in the near future.


It is plainly embarrassing to old and new Members alike that the odious phrase enemy States remains in our Charter. We must consider it a disgrace that we were unable to remove this anachronism before the admission of new Members this year.


It is high time indeed for deliberations on the ways to adapt our Organization more effectively to the increasingly heavy demands that will be, and because of the inevitability of future history must be, placed on the United Nations. Our distinguished and able Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, has raised for all of us the fundamental question in very clear terms in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization:


	Do the majority of Member States really want an Organization which is more than a conference machinery and a forum for the pursuit of national policies? Do they really want an Organization which can play a useful and active role in focusing international efforts on the solution of the most difficult and controversial problems. . .? 


Those are the questions posed to us by the Secretary-General. 


In my view, the answer to these questions is at the present time neither yes nor no. The Members are ambivalent about the United Nations. They begin to see the absolute and inescapable necessity for the Organization to perform functions global in scope that no States nor group of States can perform by themselves. At the same time, implied in implementing vital tasks for the world community is a major change, if one might say so, in gravity, a shift in focus from go-it-alone national attitudes and mechanisms to machinery for global co-operation, consensus and the common pursuit of collective solutions.


But we cannot expect to enjoy the fruits of collective action on common problems without prior commitment to a community approach. International peace and security, collective economic security, disarmament and universal human rights will always elude us unless the prerequisite commitments to common processes are firmly and finally made.


It is with those considerations in mind that the Government of the Philippines has resolutely stood for the improvement of our Organization. I wish to make it absolutely clear that we have taken this approach for no ulterior motives. We have none. We have not undertaken it from ambition for a special place in the Organization. We have none. We have not undertaken it as the agent for any super-Power or for any nation other than ourselves. Our concern is simply to help bring our Organization up to the highest peak of efficiency and effectiveness achievable at this critical time. We are well aware, like the majority of Members, that this is not the case today. As, during the coming year, we prepare for a sober consideration of the views and suggestions of Members for the improvement of the world Organization, we anticipate that all Members will be giving this important endeavour the serious reflection it deserves and requires. We look forward to co-operating again with like-minded colleagues from many countries as we recommence the work we began on the twenty-fifth anniversary of our Organization.


This, too, is an anniversary yearthe twenty-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, one of the noblest, most far-reaching texts of man, and a testimonial to the essential soundness of mankind's vision and aspiration. The acceptance of a guide of planetary norms for the treatment of human beings is wholly without precedent. Its adoption marked a new ""coming of age"" of the human race. For the first time, man, the noblest of species, was called upon to respond and to respect the integrity of all of its own kind.


The intervening years have seen stumbling progress, halting progress, but real and substantial progress nevertheless. Yet the right to self-determination, the only basic human right enshrined in both of the International Covenants on human rights (see resolution 2200 A (XXI)), continues to be defiantly denied to remaining colonies, particularly in Africa. And above all evils, the evil of apartheid and other forms of racial discrimination still divides us, still pits man against man, still inflicts wounds on the body of mankind.

We are embarking on a new effort to eradicate most ancient evil. We all have our responsibilities in this regard. But some Members in a position to effect change have a particular and unique responsibility and, if I might say so, the opportunity to ring down the curtain on this aspect of man's inhumanity to man. Does the exercise of this opportunity cost something in terms of short-term strained relations or immediate benefit? Then we must ask, What is that cost, compared to the freeing of whole enclaves of humanity into their proper estate, and to the gratitude which will be universally felt?

We welcome the growing spirit of detenteas long as it bears fruits to be shared by all the world. It should, for instance, extend to the Middle East and inspire a new and determined effort to resolve that crisis on the basis of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). And detente should be merely the prelude to renewed and intensified efforts within the larger framework of our Organization to find concord and to tackle the blights of our planet with resources released from strife. A detente that stops short will be a source of disappointment, and can even become a source of global danger. For detente is only the beginning of opportunityopportunity to approach the neglected agenda of man's most urgent needs. The United Nations has recently been the birthplace of important new concepts of the greatest potential importance for peace and justice. In connexion with the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the concept of the common heritage of mankind was born. In connexion with the material disparities which are inflicting untold suffering on the southern world, the concept of collective economic security is now under consideration and elaboration, together with the Mexican proposal for a charter of economic rights and duties of States, which may ultimately become one of the means for the emancipation of man from want and hunger. Only when that comes to pass will the full dimensions of human creative energies become manifest.

In any case, we must begin immediately to plan together and to plan carefully for the equitable access of all peoples to the finite resources and benefits of our small, beautiful and irreplaceable planet. To protect short-term gains against the requirements of long-term global planning is to prepare the world for strife and the human race for suicide. While we have time, there is, as we have often been reminded, no time to spare. If we cannot plan for our collective future in the United Nations, then where shall we confront the task? Progress thus far has given only mild reason for hope and, in some areas, it has been plainly disappointing. For instance, which of the resolutions adopted at the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development have been honoured and implemented? Which? To what extent are the goals of the Second United Nations Development Decade to be achieved? The record so far has not been encouraging, and it sharply challenges complacency. History will judge harshly those that have the power, and thus the opportunity and responsibility to act, and yet have so far neglected to do so.

The importance of the Conference on the Law of the Sea is well understood by us all. In particular, the Conference will provide for archipelagic countries like my own the possibility of a much more adequate recognition of our special problems, which have been ignored in the past. The Philippines, in common with other archipelagic States, has a profound interest in this question, and we intend to take an active part in its detailed consideration by the appropriate Committee of the Assembly.

All States stand to benefit from the rationalization of the law of the sea. And, as cannot be said too often, the placing of the bulk of the resources of the sea under the auspices of a new United Nations regime will guarantee new economic benefits, equitably shared, and the preservation and protection of the common heritage of mankind. To achieve that goal will require a high degree of restraint and a sense of community born of a truly enlightened self-interest. To fail to exercise this attitude at the forthcoming Conference would be to forfeit one of the major opportunities now open to the family of nations. The measure of joint planning and consensus for mutual benefit at the Conference will be the measure of maturity in the world community.

Not only will the Conference on the Law of the Sea be held next year, but, as we are also aware, the World Population Conference will convene during a year dedicated to a re-evaluation of the carrying capacity of the planet and of the responsibilities of each nation with regard to population questions, a field in which the United Nations Fund for Population Activities has been rendering exceptionally efficient and commendable service. Each of these major issues which has come before this Organizationas, last year, the vital question of preserving and enhancing the human environment was before usserves to demonstrate the overriding need for effective world approaches and for effective world institutions to implement them. Thus, each passing year underlines the importance of our work and can serve to renew our determination to succeed in our endeavours.

In the light of those considerations, it is to be regretted that this year has not seen more substantial progress in halting and reversing the arms race, which, like a cancerous growth on the body of humanity, parasitically drains off so much of the world's material and scientific wealth not only into non-productive but into monstrously threatening channels. It is a matter of particular regret to the nations of the Pacific basin that the appeals of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly with regard to the end of all nuclear testing have gone unheeded. While we welcome whatever forward motion has been registered in the existing forums, the results are disappointingly meagre and slow, leaving humanity still in jeopardy and with an uncertain future. The acceleration of progress towards a ban on all nuclear tests should be the overriding considerationnot whether one or another forum at any particular time should be given eminence.

We fully realize that no single meeting or series of meetings, no single forum or series of forums will provide instant general disarmament. Yet we believe that each avenue which offers some promise of greater understanding and progress should be most seriously considered. We would point out that progress made during the coming year will assist greatly in ensuring a productive review of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (resolution 2373 (XXII)).

General and complete disarmament, in the long run, depends, as it always has, upon the simultaneous creation of a viable and just world order able to assume and discharge the responsibilities of peace-making and peace-keeping and the safeguarding of equity and justice that no nation or group of nations can ever again provide for themselves. It is thus urgent that we begin thinking in parallelin designing provision for the parallel augmentation of our international institutions for global peace and security at the same time that we redouble our efforts to curtail and finally to end the nuclear arms race. Nor must the conventional arms races in areas of tensionwhich until now have been all too often overlookedbe neglected. Not only do they take on ruinous economic dimensions and threaten military disaster for the States concerned, but they can also serve as the fuses for general conflict. We would hope that the United Nations may be encouraged to assume a part of the task once performed by the League of Nations in the publication of available data on arms budgets and arms transfers. Such publication would be wholly without prejudice to the parties concerned, but would provide the world community with instructive information and perhaps guidelines as a basis for action in dealing with this extremely important problem.

In a related field, my Government takes a profound interest in the forthcoming conference on human rights in armed conflict, called at the suggestion of the International Committee of the Red Cross. We particularly applaud the efforts of those whose far-sighted and humanitarian endeavours are directed to limitations and restrictions on particularly indiscriminate or cruel weapons, and we remain hopeful of progress in this area.

Each year of the following decade, like the years of the past decade, is sure to be described as unprecedented; and each time the statement is made it will be absolutely correct. Our annual meeting provides the opportunity for a trip to the mountain-top to broaden our perspective, renew our vision and chart a course of constructive change for the period ahead. At times, all that is required is course correction; at other times, major shifts in orientation and commitment are inescapable. No less than the best we have to offer will suffice to see us through the fateful changes of the period immediately ahead.

Its major characteristics will relate to the implementation of interdependence in new institutions and in adaptation of the best of the old; they will relate to the central fact of irreversible human convergence and to the need for securing the richness of human diversity as the accompaniment of human unity. It has been well said that we have no alternative but to enact our age-old idealsfor purely technical reasons. The planet cannot be steered save from the cockpit of Spaceship Earth on which, for better or for worse, we are all fellow travellers. The requirements of its passengers cannot be analysed or quantified adequately except from the central clearing-house. What our individual nations can perform adequately for their peoples can, should and will remain with them; what they cannot, must be pooled for accommodation and the hammering out of collective decisions. The road of conscious comity leads to a peaceful and harmonious future; the alternate road of separatism and self-defeating selfishness leads to disaster.

Our United Nations gains daily in importance in the discharge of our common task. May it gain daily also in the commitment of its Members."	1973-10-02
Carlos P. Romulo	UNGA 29	"??The Philippines offers its warmest congratulations to Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Foreign Minister of Algeria, on his election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. President Boutetlika's background is that of a revolutionary, and that is what the world needs right nowa dedicated revolutionary.

In the session just past, we depended on the ripe wisdom of Mr. Leopoldo Benites to guide us through a series of crises more formidable than many we have faced in previous years. Having succeeded in drawing up the firm guidelines for coping with crises, we must now lean upon the vitality, the energy and the strong convictions of this youthful new President of the Assembly to see us through the next, and even more difficult, stages of implementing agreements reached in principle.

We wish to congratulate at this time and to welcome into our midst the latest members of the United Nations, the new sovereign States of Grenada, Bangladesh, and Guinea-Bissau. Their presence here is another affirmation of the powerful tides of self-determination which began sweeping the world shortly after the end of the Second World War. It is to the credit of Portugal, and a stern warning to the remaining colonial Powers in Africa, that it has recognized and accepted the fact that the course of decolonization is irreversible.

We listened this morning \[2242nd meeting] to the moving statement of the representative of Honduras. I hasten to assure him, on behalf of the Philippine Government, of our deepest sympathies for the tragic calamity which has befallen his people. I come from a country which is periodically buffeted by typhoons and often devastated by floods, and we in the Philippines understand the suffering of the Honduran people. We feel for them deeply.

The accession to the presidency of Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika is appropriate and timely in a very important sense. The world is in the midst of an economic dislocation so grave that its repercussions are bound to be felt far into the future. While all nations are in the grip of these dangerous economic trends, it is the developing nations which today feel its effects most strongly. Indeed, many of them are on the brink of economic collapse.

As a recognized leader among the developing countries, our new President can be expected to provide profound insights into their difficulties. At the same time, he is in a position to moderate what we most wish to avoid, namely, the degeneration of the understandable conflicts of interest between the rich and the poor countriesconflicts inherent in the present economic systeminto bitter and frustrating confrontation. The future of mankind, both of its affluent and of its disadvantaged segments, lies not in confrontation but in co-operation based on equity and justice.

Addressing the Governing Council of UNDP at its eighteenth session held in Manila earlier this year, the President of the Philippines called strongly for the immediate implementation of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and of its accompanying Programme of Action. He was the first Head of State to do so in an international forum. Recalling the debates during the sixth special session of the General Assemblyan historic special sessionhe said:

""[The] concern [of the sixth special session] was not with the past but rather with the present and future. Historical injustices were recalled, not to be exacerbated but to be redressed and transcended. The challenge presented to the rich, industrialized countries was not to irreconcilable conflict but to a massive joint commitment to fashion together a more rational and equitable relationship.""

The grim prospects confronting the developing countries emphasize the importance of institutionalizing this new type of relationship as promptly as possible. Time has made their economic problems more acute, with further deterioration in sight in the coming year. Nor can we overlook the possibility of political and social upheavals in the wake of irresistible inflationary pressures coupled with worsening shortages.

The encouraging rise in commodity prices has now reached a peak and will soon decline. Only a quarter of the considerable gain in commodity prices went to the developing regions, and of this gain the bulk was negated by the steep increases in the prices of food grains and fertilizers.

Furthermore, the developing countries experienced sharp deficits in trade in 1973, with every prospect that the deficits will increase this year.

Few aspects of the world-wide economic upheaval cut closer to the bone than the food crisis. What was once viewed as an unfortunate but temporary state of affairs is now correctly regarded as a chronic condition which will grow worse in time unless concerted international action is taken promptly.

Despite the expected difficulties, however, the gross national product of the Philippines increased by 5.8 per cent in the first eight months of 1974, a figure which is higher than in previous years, with the exception of 1973. Last year the Philippines was in the upper third in the roll of developing countries which exceeded the target growth rate set by the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] in the field of manufactures.

As a result of measures taken to prevent massive rice shortages caused by typhoons, the Philippines increased its grain production by 12 per cent, short of self-sufficiency, but enough to avert widespread shortages in the event of expected natural calamities.

Overall food production, however, is at a record level, the Philippines being one of only four Asian countries to show this remarkable performance in a year of falling production in most developing regions.

In another field, the Philippines is among the fortunate few to exceed the amount of $200 million in gains in international reserves.

But the Philippines is under no illusion that its present generally favourable situation will persist if the world-wide economic situation continues to deteriorate. Nor can it dissociate itself from the plight of other, poorer countries which are now rapidly approaching the point of irreversible descent into anarchy and chaos caused by extreme poverty. Whether we wish it or not, their fate instils an awful sense of foreboding in the entire human community.

It is in this context that we view the arms race and the ever-increasing amounts wasted in its pursuit as a terrible comment on our sense of human values. It bespeaks a deadening of the finer impulses of man that he should place the development of weapons of destruction on a far higher scale of priority than the fulfilment of his most basic requirements.

Nor is this race for weapons confined to the great Powers, for the supply of arms to the smaller Powers has increased at an unprecedented rate thereby increasing the danger of conventional wars, which nevertheless always carry the risk of involving the great Powers.

An equally disturbing development is the dangerous proliferation of nuclear weapons. The capability for manufacturing them is no longer the exclusive monopoly of the rich, industrialized countries. This suggests that the threshold of nuclear danger has been lowered to a degree that may in the near future prove dangerous to world peace and security. That there should be nations whose populations are starving and afflicted by famine but that are producing nuclear arms is indeed a sad commentary on the world today.

In the light of the foregoing developments, the United Nations should begin seriously to consider fresh initiatives to moderate the runaway arms race, halt nuclear proliferation and ban test explosions completely.

These matters acquire particular significance at a time when the Middle East problem still carries the potential for renewed conflict and at a time when agreement has yet to be reached on the tragic war in Cyprus. On the Middle East question, we of the Philippine delegation reiterate our view that a just solution should be based on the relevant United Nations resolutions calling on Israel to withdraw from all occupied territories.

Another important aspect of the Middle East problem, which is basic to its solution, is the question of the Palestinian people. Having no wish at this time to reopen a generation-old debate, I shall confine myself to quoting my original intervention in the Assembly on the same subject in 1947, when the sessions were being held at Flushing Meadows. I said then:

""We have assessed the legal arguments and found that they are not the decisive factors in shaping a just and practical solution. Whatever the weight we might choose to assign to the arguments of the one side or the other, it is clear to the Philippine Government that the rights conferred by mandatory power, even if subsequently confirmed by an international agreement, do not vitiate the primordial right of a people to determine the political future and to preserve the territorial integrity of its native land.""

Continuing, I said that the issue was primarily moral and that the enforcement of the partition policy wasand I quote againrepugnant to the valid nationalist aspirations of the people of Palestine.

Because the shape of the problem has been modified in the intervening years, the Philippines shall, against this background, speak on this subject again at an appropriate time in this Assembly.

Turning to our part of the world, the spirit of the Shanghai communique is alive in Asia, and a rearrangement in the balance of forces on its basis has ensued quietly and without fanfare. The apparent stability in the region has encouraged diplomatic activity, tending further to cement existing relationships. Prime Minister Tanaka of Japan visited South-East Asia, and Prime Minister Whitlam of Australia made a similar tour earlier this year.

The pursuit of normalized relations between the Peoples Republic of China and South-East Asian countries continues. In mid-1974, Malaysia established full diplomatic relations with the Peoples Republic, and trade and cultural missions from Peking and various South-East Asian capitals have exchanged visitsvisible evidences of a more relaxed relationship between them. At this very moment, Mrs. Imelda Marcos, wife of the President of the Philippines and his designated envoy, is in Peking on a goodwill mission and has been very well received there.

Behind these activities lies the hope that the new balance of power will be a force for constructive changes on the basis of complementary interests, not alone among the big Powers with interests in the region, but also between them and the smaller Asian Powers.

However, the problem of stability and security in the region remains the principal responsibility of the nations of the region. Among the six member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN], the first large step in enhanced economic co-operation was taken this year when active negotiations began on the implementation of industrial complementation projects and on the establishment of a free-trade zone in the region. An expanding web of relationships has also begun to develop between the ASEAN member countries and other countries and organizations, with, among others, Australia and New Zealand, and with the European Economic Community.

Much, of course, remains to be done to ensure the security of the region. As long as the Paris agreement remains unenforcedand apparently unenforceablethe situation in Indo-China will continue to be a threat to the general security of South-East Asia.

In the Khmer Republic, an unprecedented situation has emerged, raising political, legal and moral questions of great complexity. Last year the Philippines opposed the back-door grant of recognition to the rival Sihanouk Government, which would give it the right to represent Khmer in the United Nations. We will continue to oppose this move, in the belief that the people of Khmer should be free to decide their own political future and to adopt the economic and social system of their choice without interference from any outside sources.

On the question of Korea, the peaceful reunification of the divided halves remains our objective, and we are prepared to lend our support to mutually acceptable means of reaching this goal. Provided it is acceptable to both the Republic of Korea and the Peoples Republic of Korea, we shall support the admission to the United Nations of both those States in the hope that this would provide an additional avenue for reaching agreement on reunification.

Let me touch on other items on the agenda that are of particular interest to us. My delegation feels that the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is one of the most significant endeavours of the world organization. The objective of developing a progressive international law based on equity and social justice in order to bring about peace and stability in the oceans and to permit the full utilization of the vast resources of the sea for the benefit of all mankind cannot be long deferred. Moreover, we cannot ignore the possibility that an area comprising two thirds of our planet will, unless agreement is reached, become yet another focus of intense rivalries dangerous to the peace of the world.

From the particular point of view of an archipelagic State like the Philippines, the Conference has given us and similar States an opportunity never before provided us to secure recognition of the unique problems arising from our geographical configuration.

Although we cannot, in complete candour, say that we were entirely satisfied with the result of the session held at Caracas, we feel that it has generated a momentum which should be maintained. It is our view, therefore, that no time should be wasted in permitting the Conference to continue its work. for this reason, the Philippines will support the recommendation that another session be convoked in Geneva from March to May 1975.

Our traditional respect for human rights and the fundamental freedoms remains undiminished. Indeed, out recent experience has given us a deeper insight into the nature and meaning of human rights. We realize today with special force the truth of the observation that the achievement of economic and social rights through accelerated national development is an indispensable requirement for the exercise of civil and political rights. Without the effective enforcement of law and order and without a sound economic base, respect for human rights remains at best theoretical. In this connexion, I am pleased to inform this Assembly that the Government of the Philippines deposited with the Secretary-General on 7 June 1974 its instruments of ratification of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights [resolution 2200 A (XXI), annex].

At this session we shall support all measures which assist in advancing the cause of human rights throughout the world. And we shall continue to give the most vigorous support to the struggle against racist policies of all varieties and against all efforts to segregate peoples on the basis of colour and race from the mainstream of their national life.

As a nation which by tradition has held women in high esteem, the Philippines favours the prompt elimination of discrimination on the basis of sex. Women in my country are the full and equal partners of men in national development; we look forward to the day when this practice is made universal. The observance of International Women's Year in 1975, for which the Philippines has already made preparations, is a timely reminder of the need to integrate women, who, after all, constitute half of the world's population, into the total human resources available for national development.

Let me reiterate that this Assembly is faced with global problems which demand global solutions. Those solutions can be achieved only through greatly enhanced international co-operation. In turn, co-operation of such scope and depth requires the full use of the United Nations in the entire range of human concerns.

As the problems become progressively more acute, the need for effective solutions becomes more urgent. Some of the sense of urgency and the strong feeling of interdependence assured by the sixth special session of the General Assembly last April still remain. Our task is to maintain the momentum generated by the special session and to continue to foster the spirit of interdependence arising out of the very seriousness of the problems which confront us.

But a fundamental element seems to be missing. In a rare note of pessimism, the Secretary-General predicted that perhaps the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly will be in the grip of a crisis of helplessness. A deficiency in determination, a lack of political will, delays the Assembly from taking the required courses of action that could lead to firm decisions. I suggest that this deficiency may also arise from the shortcomings of the Charter itself, a Charter which, as I shall presently explain, contributes to a sense of division rather than of harmony in the context of today's realities. My delegation therefore welcomes the recommendation of the General Committee that item 95 entitled ""Need to consider suggestions regarding the review of the Charter of the United Nations: report of the Secretary-General should be retained on this year's agenda.

Over the past 30 years, events and long-term developments have imposed the conclusion that the structure and processes adopted at the end of the last world war by the victorious allies very quickly lost their relevance and validity. I speak as one of the original signatories of the Charter in 1945 at the San Francisco Conference. The ideological confrontation destroyed the possibility of unanimity among the five permanent members of the Security Council, and their veto power was transformed from a guarantee of international unity into an instrument for the protection of national interests.

It is needless to review, for all of us remember, the various conflicts, large and smal1, brief or protracted, for which the Organization, under its present Charter, was unable to find a solution, much less to enforce one. More and more often, solutions have been sought, and sometimes found, outside the framework of what was originally conceived to be the unchallengeable arbiter of the world's disputes.

Perhaps the original ideal was impractical, beyond the possibility of realization in a world of sovereign States. All the more reason, then, to undertake a serious and continuing review and revision of the structure and procedures of the Organization. The last of the Western colonial empires is now in liquidation; the emancipated nations have almost tripled the membership of the United Nations, while the former metropolitan Powers, which could formerly presume to represent their millions of subjects, can now speak only for themselves. On the other hand, it is perhaps understandable that they should seek protection against what may appear to them to be the tyranny of numbers at a time of a proliferation of States in various stages of development but all equally jealous of their equality in the vote.

Few will deny that the United Nations has devised ingenious procedures to overcome the inherent limitations of the present Charter. It has broadened the scope of its activities to cover a wide spectrum of issues which the founders of the Organ. ization never anticipated. Still, for our time, the Charter fails to reach the heart of the matter, which is the disturbing division between the developing and developed countries, or, to put it more bluntly, the few rich and the many poor. Never in the history of the United Nations has that division been more apparent that it is today.

The paramount need of the United Nations is a Charter which provides the institutional means for reconciling the two sides, for bridging the gap between them, and for inducing them to co-operate, instead of deepening the distrust in which they hold one another. On these terms alone l if no other, there is, I submit, little to be lost if we place the provisions of the Charter under continuing review, to study how they work and have worked in the past and, above all, to explore the possibilities of bringing them more in accord with present realities.

It is disheartening to see the United Nations unable for all these long years to put an end to the Palestinian problem, to the apartheid regime in South Africa, to the illegitimate occupation of Namibia, to so many other situations that haunt session after session of the General Assembly like ghosts that can neither be buried nor forgotten.

It is disillusioning to see the United Nations playing no direct part in reshaping the international monetary system.

It is deeply dismaying to realize that the United Nations, for all the bright promises of its Charter and declarations and proclamations, is unable to do more to protect the human rights of millions of human beings. No doubt, there are seriouslegal and political difficulties to be faced in any study or revision of the Charter. Such a revision might even entail its renegotiation. Any fundamental change is painful and calls for much thought and heart-searching; but when change is needed for survival, it is inevitable.

Allow me to illustrate this with an, example from our own national experience in the Philippines. Two years ago, almost to this very date, the President of our country placed it under martial law. It Was within his constitutional powers to do so, as the Supreme Court of the Republic decided only last week; but it was also a very drastic, even revolutionary measure, for it meant a fundamental change, a radical revision of our political and social structure and institutions which had been part of our way of life since the proclamation of our independence in 1946-almost the same length of time as the United Nations has existed-and, indeed, for about 40 years before that.

The change was a shock; it was agonizingly painful to many; but it worked, and it is working. It forestalled a revolution that, after all, sought only the samegoals; it staved off financial ruin; it restored peace and 'promised social order. Above all, it worked because it brought the constitutional and governmental structure and processes into line with the political, economic and social realities in a nation that had been groping for the true balance between them for more than a quarter-century.

We in the United Nations, I dare to suggest, have also been trying to strike that true balance for almost the same measure of time. To find it now, when it is so needed, if not for survival, at least for significance and effectiveness, we must, I suggest, be equally bold after long patience; we must be persistent with long deliberation and unafraid of radical departures when confident of our ultimate destination. For that reason my delegation will support, and indeed sponsor, any initiative to establish a continuing or permanent group to study the revision of the Charter and submit recommendations thereon.

Two years ago, at this same forum, I made the observation that radical changes had overtaken the world. How profound these changes were we now fully realize. The detente begun in Asia and subsequently followed in Europe has, for all practical purposes, revised the structure of international relations. The beginning of concord and harmony in the political field, despite temporary setbacks, has become visible, and our hopes are buoyed by the rich possibilities of peace and security for all mankind. We fully expect it to create the environment in which we can pursue with greater vigour the progress and development of nations.

Today, we are at the painful beginning of that search for progress. Because we view the problems at such close range, we tend to be traumatized by their immense difficulties. The danger is that this should lead to a fatal paralysis of will, leaving the problems unsolved and worse than they were before. I venture to say that in the midst of difficulties we have learned the lesson that today, more than ever, we must shed parochialism, discard selfishness, and dismiss the narrower demands of sheer self-interest. Never before has this thought emerged with greater clarity and force: if our society is to survive, we must accept collective responsibility for its well-being. Interdependence has ceased to be a mere pious wish. Inevitable, indeed inescapable, it is the very basis for the continuation of the society of man in the twentieth century."	1974-09-25
Imelda R. Marcos	UNGA 30	"With your kind permission, I shall address the representatives here in the name and in representation of the Head of State of the Republic of the Philippines, President Ferdinand E. Marcos. He has designated me to deliver on his behalf a special message to this thirtieth anniversary session of the General Assembly which coincides with International Women's Year.

Let me begin by conveying to you, Mr. President the cordial felicitations of the Government and people of the Republic of the Philippines upon your election to the leadership of the General Assembly at such an important Juncture in the life of the United Nations.

The Philippines joins in the warm welcome extended to the three new Members of our Organizations: Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, and Mozambique. Their entry into the family of independent nations marks another milestone in the inexorable march of decolonization in Africa. We also look forward to welcoming our neighbour, Papua New Guinea, into the United Nations.

My country was one of the original signatories of the Charter of the United Nations and is therefore a founding Member of this world Organization. Many of you will recall that our own esteemed General Carlos P. R:omu\o, who later became President of the fourth session of the General Assembly, signed the Charter on behalf of the Republic of the Philippines. Having_ been present at its creation, the Philippines has a vital stake in the survival of the United Nations.

As we all know, the survival of the United Nations has been threatened for many years by a dangerous struggle for political and military advantage between two so-called ""worlds"". But underneath it a new confrontation was taking shape. As the force of historic colonialism diminished and withered away, new nations emerged--a third world that sought, not supremacy, but equality and justice. This new world sought to challenge the economic and social order inherited from an age that had in fact come to an end, an order that was no longer rational or equitable or justified--if indeed it had ever been.

My country inevitably shared in this new confrontation; we identified ourselves with other developing nations in the common search for a just distribution of the human heritage. This is why I bring with me the resurgent hope of a developing country in Asia. We dare to believe that the great and fortunate Powers of the world have at last acknowledged the aspirations of the third world.

We aspire not to dispossess or to deprive the rich, but to claim our legitimate heritage. For decades, we have indeed been insisting that the predatory politics of the past were formidable obstacles to our development. But there is this resurgent hope, a hope sparked by the consensus reached at the seventh special session, which marks a turning-point in world affairs. That consensus should necessarily be the primary concern of this Assembly.

That concern would be reflected in the reordering of priorities in the agenda of this Assembly. The various aspects of a new international economic order must rank equally in importance with the political questions of special interest to the great Powers.

Peace is essential to development. That is why we are gratified by the spirit of conciliation and mutual accommodation that inspired the recent agreement in the Middle East. But peace is not measurable in military and political terms alone. There can be no peace in our world until conditions of life worthy of the dignity of man are achieved in the developing countries.

Certainly we understand the importance of the search for national security. Still, we must note how the people of the world deplore the madness of an armaments race that yearly dissipates more than $300,000 million in weapons of death in the midst of mass hunger and privation in the developing countries.

For this reason, we cannot accept the thesis that the search for peace and the promotion of development are not concurrent but consecutive tasks. We therefore commend this Assembly for adhering to the view of the vast majority of mankind that peace and development, being inseparably interlinked, should be concurrent undertakings.

We could go further and suggest that the creation of a new World economic order is a proper field for the application of detente. We hope that this stage will be reached in due course. The sooner the better. It is only when detente among the great nations and the great Powers becomes a positive and substantial factor in the international economic order that it will be truly meaningful for the developing countries. The specific measures contained in the concluding resolution of the seventh special session, approved as it was by an unexpected and unprecedented unanimous vote, lay the basis and framework for pragmatic cooperation. But it remains to be seen if and how they are actually implemented.

Much hard bargaining is ahead of us on the terms of international trade, on market structures in the field of raw materials and commodities, on indexation and buffer stocks, on tariff preferences, on the transfer of resources and technology, on monetary reform, on the tragic problem of food, indeed on all the aspects of a new world economic order.

Let us not forget that with all the proliferation of conferences and resolutions, plans, funds and councils, we still find ourselves, at this mid-point of the Second United Nations Development Decade, very far indeed from a just and equitable world society. It has been many years since the United Nations officially fixed 0.7 per cent of the gross national product as a fair annual rate for assistance from industrial countries [see resolution 2626 (XXV)]. Yet even now the richest countries in the world extend development assistance in an amount far below the official United Nations target. But dare we hope that, in the new spirit of conciliation and co-operation, Member nations might be prepared to consider a more reliable means of financing development?

The unpredictable fluctuations in the amount of internationalassistance extended in any given year have made it almost impossible for national and international authorities to plan balanced development on a long-term basis. Would Member nations, rich and poor, of whatever economic or social system, be prepared to consider restructuring international development assistance by basing it on fixed assessments in accordance with objective criteria?

Under such a system, development could be pursued on a more stable and systematic basis, little influenced by political and military considerations. Jf this system is adopted, it will make the poverty of nations and the hunger of peoples a truly global and human concern. All nations should be assessed according to their capabilities as an earnest of our sincerity about pursuing the universal goal of the general consensus. International co-operation for development has become too important, too crucial a factor in the new world economic order to remain at the mercy of voluntary contributions. 

Indeed, if we are in earnest, we should be prepared, rich and poor alike, to give world development more generous and more dependable support. This we must consider now: just as the United Nations is supported by contributions from all nations, so should world development be supported. This suggestion may seem visionary to some, but to us it is attainable, a goal worth striving for. 

That is why it is imperative to widen the dialogue on the new world economic order. In this age of increasing interdependence, the United Nations is the only Organization in which the necessary dialogue can be conducted and consensus achieved on the building of a new world order. The Member nations should therefore seize the opportunity to move the United Nations from the periphery to the centre of world affairs. The consultations and negotiations within the United Nations system and related forums should be maintained and intensified. Every effort should also be made to enlarge the consensus among Members on each side-the developed countries on the one hand, the developing countries on the otheras an essential step towards wider and more generally acceptable agreements.

On the side of the developing countries, an important stage in the continuing search for wider consensus will be reached in the Philippines in February 1976, when the ministerial meeting of the Group of 77 is held at Manila, in preparation for the fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, which will be convened at Nairobi next May.

The dialogue, so important for the future of mankind, should no longer be left exclusively to diplomats, politicians and bureaucrats. It should not be limited to Governments bargaining with other Governments here in the General Assembly and in other international forums. The time has come to engage not only Governments but also the peoples which they represent. The time has come to bring to life the provision of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] calling for intensive, concerted mobilization of world opinion.

We are convinced that the creation of the new world economic order is too big a task for Governments alone to accomplish.

In order to implement their solemn commitments in the consensus decisions of the seventh special session, the Governments of the industrial countries will need the understanding, consent and support of their constituencies of their own peoples. So will the Governments of developing countries in discharging their own responsibilities.

As the Secretary-General has pointed out, the international consensus on the new world economic order must be matched by a corresponding domestic consensus. Otherwise, there is a danger that the professions of interdependence and co-operation will amount to little more than well-intentioned lip-service. The critical testing-ground will therefore be in our respective national constituencies, because the fundamental structural reforms implicit in the new world economic order will inevitably affect domestic policies and practices; they will require basic changes in political and social attitudes.

Our appeal therefore must be directed to peoples, to their sense of what is right and fair. Certainly, our peoples can perceive that the problems of the world, including those of an economic nature, cannot be reduced to mere material terms. The solutions to the world's economic problems must have a moral basis.

The problems facing us today have moral roots -in injustice, intolerance, greed and dominance by the strong. Their solutions, then, if they are to be effective and enduring, cannot be sought in man's acquisitive nature but in his sense of justice and sense of community with his fellow men.

It is clear that international relations including economic relations, must no longer be based merely on the balance of conflicting interests nor on the unremitting competition among nations over material objectives but on the moral principles accepted by all mankind--justice, fair sharing, mutual understanding and co-operation, tolerance, the protection of the weak and freedom from domination by the strong.

These universal moral principles could be embodied in the international code of ethics governing relations among nations. The international community has already adopted the International Development Strategy, the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [re.solution 3281 (XXIX)] and the Declaration of the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-VI)]. The idea of a code of conduct for transnational corporations has gained almost universal acceptance. We can now extend our attention to a more comprehensive international code of ethics which should guide the entire range of the behaviour of nations towards one another.

Central to the proposed international code of ethics are the principles of sovereign equality and Self-determination, taking into account national aspirations for self-reliance and the equitable distribution of the goods of Ife among the nations of the world.

A sincere commitment to an international code. of ethics will free mankind from the tyrannies that have stifled the full development of so large a sector of humanity: the tyranny of circumstance, which has Kept men and nations prisoners of historical events; the tyranny of power blocs, which has curtailed the rights of many nations to make autonomous decisions for the welfare of their own peoples; and the tyranny of ideological dogmas, which has constrained Governments from devising practical solutions to concrete problems.

The code of ethics that should animate the relations among nations is rooted in the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations. It is in the very foundations of our Organization, therefore, that we should search for the solutions to the problems that confront us.

May we not say, too, that this code of ethics is inspired by the morality of the oppressed, the oppressed who seek not dominance but the simplest right to live as decent human beings? We have not forgotten, I trust, that our civilizations, our religions, all those great movements which exalt the human spirit have been leavened by the morality of the oppressed.

It is in accordance with this view that we in the Philippines have placed the moral imperative at the very heart of our development programme. We believe that the goal of economic and social justicethe human goal which we require of the international communityshould also be a cardinal aim within nations and societies. This is the very essence of the new society which President Marcos and the Philippine people are striving to build in our country

It is rare experience, on this occasion, to gain at first hand such a vivid sense of history in the making. This thirtieth session of the General Assembly provides a unique opportunity for shaping a better future for mankind

The new international economic order confronts ot only our instinct for survival or our natural desire for material well-being but also the deepest values of our civilization. The challenge, therefore, is ultimately addressed to the conscience of humanity. We are called upon to create a new moral image of man.

At the threshold of action, we should pause and reflect on the kind of world we want for ourselves and for the generations yet to come. We could aim simply for a world of coexistence, of minimum ""give and take"", of nothing more than ""live and let live""--until the next conflict.

But we could raise our sights and aspire to the kind of world envisioned in our Charter: a world of compassion; a world without borders where basic human needs are concerned; a world of tolerance, of dignity, of respect and reverence for life--a just world, an authentic human community."	1975-09-24
Carlos P. Romulo	UNGA 31	"I should confess, Mr. President, that every year that I have approached this rostrumand I have been doing so, off and on, for 31 yearsI have felt increasingly like a defendant about to be asked why judgement should not be rendered against him. I submit that it is of primary importance that we should face up to the growing scepticism, cynicism and even hostility with which our deliberations are viewed by many, and I propose to address myself to this problem in the course of these remarks.

No doubt, Sir, you and the Secretary-General have shared this unease, and it was for that reason that I hesitated to offer you at this time the ritual congratulations upon your well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly this year. The controversies and confrontations that marked past sessions did not seem to provide favourable and happy auguries for your incumbency.

None the less, I avail myself of this traditional opportunity to extend to you my most cordial and sincere wishes for your success, and indeed to express my confidence that you will achieve it with the personal qualities of leadership which you have more than amply demonstrated in guiding the complicated negotiations on the law of the sea, as well as the devotion and dedication, displayed during your many years of service here, to the ideals and objectives of the United Nations.

Yet we would be less than honest with ourselves were we not to admit that our Organization is in crisis. That is a hackneyed way of putting it, and it would be even more commonplace to call it crisis of confidence, even of self-confidence. But the fact is that manytoo manyoutside our Organization, and even inside it, have lost confidence in it. They no longer believe, as they once believed, in the United Nations, in the way in which it works, in its mission, in its relevance.

This scepticism is focused, above all, on this General Assembly, where it is claimed that a so-called automatic majority imposes its will without rhyme or reason, deaf to argument, contemptuous of compromise, coherent only in cant and prejudice, approving resolutions that cannot be realistically enforced, proclaiming objectives that cannot be reasonably achieved. What is more, it is charged that this majority is not a majority at all, but a conspiracy of wilful minorities, each pursuing its own selfish purpose or advantage, or coercing the real majority into a meaningless unity under threats of exclusion and isolation.

There is an easy way to dismiss these accusations. One can reply that the sceptics, critics and cynics come from some of the rich industrial Powers that have seen their own automatic majorities of the past dwindle and disappear, that are frustrated by the united political will of their former colonies and clients, and that fear the end of the old international economic order, whose inequitable privileges and advantages they are determined to defend and preserve.

I have said that that is an easy answer. I suggest that it may also be a superficial and even dangerous view: superficial, because it does not correspond to the realities of the world in which we live; and dangerous, because it invites division and confrontation. We are all going through an era of profound changes in international relations, and in a time of change the primordial need is for adjustment and acceptance of that adjustment.

Those of us who met in San Francisco in 1945 and who worked in and with the United Nations in the following two decadespersonally, I have missed only about five sessions of the General Assemblylook back now and have reason to exclaim: ""How the United Nations has changed!"" And that is perhaps at the bottom of the disenchantment, even the shock, experienced by many of the present critics of the Organization and our General Assembly.

Of course the United Nations has changed. It has changed because the world has changedchanged in ways that the United Nations itself helped to bring about. It may be that some of the founding fathers at San Francisco sought or hoped to immobilize the patterns of power at the end of the Second World War, toso to speakstop the world at 1945. If so, such a hope was unfounded and doomed.

But speaking for myself, I must say that that was not my view or expectation when I helped to write the Charter in 1945. I have always had a kinetic view of the United Nations; I have always believed that the United Nations was and should be an instrument of change, that change was its mission: change in the old colonial empires, with the emancipation of subject peoples; change in the structures of racial and sex discrimination; change in the inequitable economic relations between the suppliers of raw materials and the manufacturers of industrial goods; change in a world of unendurable division between rich and poor, starving and well fed, the princes and the potentates managing the future, and the wretched without a future.

Now the process of change has reached its critical point and, as in the past, it can best be judged in this General Assembly. If the balance of forces here is what it is, it is because that is what our world is like. We are out of Bretton Woods, thank God, and we have not remained asleep since Lake Success. We cannot keep the calendar at 1945.

That is what I should like the sceptics, critics and cynics to bear in mind when they pass judgement on the work and the workings of the General Assembly. Our task now, asin my conceptionit has always been, is to bring about a better world; and that means necessarily to change the world. Our task here is to voice the demand of the majority, a true majority, of the inhabitants of this earth, for a meaningful change in their lives, to seek and promote that change, to ease the essential adjustments to that change, not through recrimination and confrontation, but through the recognition and reconciliation of legitimate interests.

If we consider the world as it really is today, we shall, I submit, understand that in bringing about the change we covet the arbitrary imposition of the will of one side upon the other can lead us nowhere. The so-called automatic numerical majority in the General Assembly is in real terms matched by what a Spanish wit called the vast minoritythe vast minority of wealth and power constituted by the industrial States. Indeed, they have nothing to fear but their own short-sightedness and selfishness.

Having said what I felt needed to be said, allow me now to undertake a brief review of the foreign policy of my Government. We in Manila too, and foremost among us our President Ferdinand E. Marcos, have for the past several years taken a hard look at the world as it really is, now in 1976, and not as it was in 1945.

Without fanfare we have in fact brought about a basic reorientation of our foreign policy as far-reaching in its implications for our foreign relations as those of our revolutionary new society are for our national development.

As recently as 1972 we had no diplomatic relations with a single socialist State. We have since quietly rectified that omission. Our establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China last year, and with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics last June, completed the normalization of our relations with the leading socialist countries.

At the same time, determined to maintain cordial relations with all friendly countries regardless of differences in ideology and social systems, we have steadily expanded our diplomatic links with developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin Americamost recently with our neighbours Democratic Kampuchea and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam; with the Somali Democratic Republic, the Central African Republic and the Gabonese Republic, in Africa; and with Cuba and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas in Latin America.

To the newly admitted Republic of Seychelles we extend a warm welcome and the assurance of our readiness to develop amicable and mutually beneficial relations.

The fundamental reorientation of our foreign policy is reflected not only in its enlarged scope but also in its content and direction. We have been moving with deliberate speed towards non-alignmentnon-alignment in its true sensea course made possible by our disengagement from the South-East Asia Treaty Organization, which we have helped to phase out; by the review of our bilateral defence agreements with the United States, in which we have reaffirmed Philippine sovereignty over the military bases in our territorywe are seeking to reduce further the period of their occupancy and insisting on strict adherence to their defensive purpose; and by our establishment of diplomatic and trade relations with the great majority of socialist States.

We have also consolidated our identification with the third world of developing countries by a series of significant initiatives including the hosting of the Third Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 in Manila last January and February and the personal participation of President Marcos at the fourth session of UNCTAD in Nairobi last May. At that Conference, as the chosen spokesman of the Group of 77, President Marcos presented the Manila Declaration and Programme of Action embodying the Group's positions on the great issues pertaining to the new international economic order. He seized the opportunity to speak forcefully on the need for change. He said:

""The time has come for the dominant powers to renounce their desire for national advantage, to proclaim an end to all unequal relationships which the developing countries have had to accept as former possessions, protectorates or colonies ... If the rich do not intervene to hasten the growth of the under-developed countries, they cannot hope to avoid being themselves caught under the weight of those whom they will not help.""

Earlier in Manila President Marcos had said in his opening address to the Group of 77 ministerial meeting:

""Power itself cannot be indefinitely monopolized; it should be shared progressively among nations if we are to inhabit a tranquil and orderly world ... And unless there is an equitable sharing of the world's resources, it could not be a question of whether, but how soon, the ever-growing number of the world's poor would challenge the ever-diminishing number of the rich for the just sharing of those resources.""

The Philippine commitment to the new international economic order, be it noted, goes beyond lip service. Out of our modest resources, the Philippines has pledged $US 50 million to initiate the common fund for the integrated programme on commodities, one of the keystones of the new international economic order. The Philippines has also subscribed to a common fund for the least developed countries with a contribution of $US 500,000 over a three-year period.

These actions reflect our concept of the new international economic order as an edifice with three levels. At the national level each country should strive to put its own house in order, rectifying economic and social inequalities, ensuring a full share for every citizen in the benefits as well as the tasks of national development, improving the quality of life nationwide. This is precisely what in essence we have been doing for the past four years in our new society. We are, of course, doing this primarily for the benefit of our own people, but we are also hoping that our new society could become a microcosm of what the new international economic order should be on a global scale.

At the regional level we are hard at work in the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] with our neighbours and associates Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. At an historic summit meeting in Bali last December the Heads of Government of the ASEAN countries resolved to co-operate in accelerating the economic development of the member countries. At the same time the foundation was laid for regional collaboration in selected industries.

We in ASEAN have our differences: religious differences, ethnic differences, differences in political and social systems. But we are united on some things which we consider important: to secure a better life for our peoples; to do everything we can, individually and collectively, to enhance the prospects for peace and to maintain the climate of freedom in our region; to support with our combined strength the concerted efforts of the third world to restructure the world economic order on the basis of justice and equality for all Members of the international community.

ASEAN is still misunderstood and sometimes maligned and misrepresented. This has not deterred us from extending the hand of friendship and peaceful collaboration to all our neighbours in South-East Asia.

To the great Powers, we say simply, ""Please leave us alone."" Kindly refrain from making South-East Asia an arena of your competing ambitions. All we want is to proceed unhampered with our own development. ASEAN is not an insignificant association. Its member nations, with a combined population of over 230 million people, inhabit an area strategically situated, rich in natural resources, potentially powerful. But our ambition is limited to seeing South-East Asia become a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality. In his policy statement on the opening day of the general debate this year, Mr. Krishna Raj Aryal, Foreign Minister of Nepal, correctly described the ASEAN proposal towards this end as: ""a constructive effort towards the strengthening of the peace, stability and development of the South-East Asian region"" [5th meeting, part I. 174]. We welcome with deep appreciation his statement that Nepal ""fully and strongly support[s] this effort"" [ibid].

At the international level the paramount need is for what we may describe as economic decolonization and for the democratization of the world's antiquated and inequitable economic structure. This is the new imperative of our time. The goal would be, in effect, a decentralization of economic power, as well as a fairer and more balanced pattern of consumption and distribution.

The time is past when developed countries could isolate themselves from the problems of the developing countries. That time is past. Like it or not, we all belong to one world, which cannot be half-rich and half-poor, or, to be more precise, one-third rich and two-thirds poor. The alleviation of poverty is a shared and collective obligation of the world community.

So is the liquidation of the remaining pockets of that older and more blatant form of colonialism: the physical subjugation of one people by another. Nowhere is this duty more pressing today than in southern Africa, where rampant oppression and racism have provoked violent uprisings threatening the peace of the entire region. The remnants of colonial tyranny and exploitation have absolutely no place in the new world order now being built.

Through the years, the Philippines has consistently and uncompromisingly supported the righteous cause of the African peoples. We helped write the provision on self-determination in the United Nations Charter in 1945, and have since then faithfully espoused the right of all colonial countries and peoples to independence. With the progress of decolonization elsewhere, our profound concern with the attainment of this major United Nations goal has increasingly focused on Africa.

In the case of southern Africa, the Philippines has scrupulously implemented United Nations decisions, including the application of economic sanctions, the severance of diplomatic and consular relations, and even the observance of sanctions in the field of sports. We dare say that few can match, let alone surpass, that record.

In this context, we welcome the determined ongoing efforts to find peaceful solutions, acceptable to all concerned, to the explosive confrontations in Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa, and we earnestly and prayerfully hope that those efforts will succeed.

Care should be taken, however, to ensure that the formulas offered for transition to majority rule in Zimbabwe, or Southern Rhodesia, should conform to the legitimate demands of the African people. Proposed solutions should not be dictated by expediency or solely by considerations for the balance of power. They should first and foremost be just solutions, consonant with the Charter and with the expressed desires and aspirations of the African people.

In the case of Namibia, the right of its people to self-determination and independence should be upheld. The Philippines joins in the demand for the withdrawal by South Africa from Namibia to enable its people to achieve freedom and independence in accordance with relevant General Assembly and Security Council resolutions.

South Africa continues to be a symbol of the travesty of the principles of the Charter and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. By its continued repression of the black majority of South Africa, the white minority rgime of that country stands condemned by world public opinion, and becomes subject to the provisions of the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid [resolution 3068 (XXVIII)], which came into force last July. Meanwhile, the struggle against apartheid through diplomatic, cultural, economic and other means should be steadfastly pursued.

I wish to speak now about two aspects of terrorism, and first, about nuclear terrorism. There is all too little separating the zealot from the nuclear trigger. Adequate safeguards have not been made available to protect nuclear reprocessing plants and transportation facilities. Since nuclear secrets are no longer secrets, the danger of nuclear terrorism increases with each passing day. It is no longer a science-fiction scenario to foresee a city held hostage and a nation rendered impotent by the threat of a nuclear explosion.

The second aspect of terrorismand this I want to emphasize and to refer to nowis the taking of innocent hostages, which has become widespread in the hijacking of airliners. Stringent international measures can undoubtedly be directed toward the protection of the innocent, in addition to those which now exist under the terms of The Hague Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, and the Montreal Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, and through the elaboration of the Standards and Practices Governing Airport Security and Aircraft Safety recommended by the International Civil Aviation Organization. The taking of innocent hostages is a heinous crime, and the Government of the Philippines, itself a victim of several aerial hijackings, will vigorously support the development of legal instruments and measures directed toward its inhibition and suppression. We now have before the Assembly the proposal of the Federal Republic of Germany [A/31/242].

I turn now to the vital question of disarmament. We share the general concern over the lack of progress in disarmament. The situation has, in fact, been deteriorating, as the Foreign Minister of Singapore, Mr. S. Rajaratnam, reminded us the other day in his thoughtful and thought-provoking policy statement [10th meeting]. I suggest that that statement be reread by the members of the General Assembly.

We are deeply disturbed by the continuing upward trend in the production, stockpiling and proliferation of armaments and particularly of the means for the production of nuclear armaments. The years go by, but not one plane or missile is dismanded except because of old age, to be replaced by new and ever more destructive models; and although we grow accustomed to their presence, they pose an ever greater threat to the survival of mankind.

The world has become increasingly alarmedand rightly soabout the spread of the means to produce nuclear weaponry. But the threat inherent in the continued ""horizontal proliferation"" of nuclear capacity is not as immediate as the continued ""vertical proliferation"" in the arms race among the nuclear Powers. Their failure to effect cutbacks in nuclear arms, or even cutbacks in ceilings for strategic nuclear systems, is a source of the gravest disappointment and alarm.

The wastage in resources that could otherwise be put to constructive uses is, indeed, staggering. As the Secretary-General has reminded us:

""Resources devoted to the arms race since the end of the Second World War have exceeded $6,000 billion, which is roughly equivalent to the 1976 gross national product of the entire world"". [A/31/1/Add.1, sect. VI].

That is tragic, indeed.

It is time, certainly, for an act of high statesmanship which can break the vicious circle of action and reaction now spiraling towards catastrophe. An announcement, for instance, ending all nuclear tests and placing a moratorium on peaceful nuclear explosions could break the present deadlock and set in motion the processes of successful negotiations. The renunciation of the most deadly chemical weaponsnerve gasescould also lead to successful negotiations, as a similar initiative did in the case of biological weapons, which are now banned from national arsenals and destroyed.

What, additionally, can the United Nations do? If a world disarmament conference cannot be held under appropriate United Nations auspices, the Philippines is prepared to support the proposal of the non-aligned group to hold a special session of the General Assembly in 1977, devoted to the problems of the arms race and disarmament. This is the very least we can do during the so-called Disarmament Decade, now fast running out.

The instrumentalities which we employ to reach decisions and agreements, and to carry out and implement their terms, must be adequate to the task. When I noted on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations that it had proved remarkably adaptable, and its founders unusually prescient, I also pointed out that the Organization was not adequate in all respects to the new requirements confronting it.

This realization was shared by others, and we are gratified that a large majority of Members now agree that a review of the structure of the United Nations, of its Charter and of possible improvements in both is, as I stated during the twenty-fifth anniversary session, ""no longer deferrable"". We welcomed the establishment by the General Assembly at its twenty-ninth session of an Ad Hoc Committee on the Charter of the United Nations to consider the observations of Governments on needed changes in the United Nations Charter, specific proposals for enhancing the ability of the United Nations to achieve its purposes, and any other suggestions for the more effective functioning of the United Nations, whether or not they would require amendments to the Charter [resolution 3349 (XXIX)].

Upon the far-sighted initiative of the Government of Romania, this Committee has now become the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization, and its membership has been increased a second time, to 47 [resolution 3499 (XXX)]. During its meetings this year, the Special Committee began its substantive work considering item by item the suggestions of members. Many valuable and innovative suggestions were made, and a number of members submitted working papers. We look forward to the renewal of the mandate of the Special Committee with very broad support, and to the continuation of its valuable work in the coming year.

We cannot, and will not, rest in this task until the United Nations is adequately equipped with the machinery and mechanisms it needs in the field of peace-keeping, the peaceful settlement of disputes, decision-making and the promotion and protection of human rights. Whatever the reasons for inaction on the part of its Members with regard to the major problems and tasks facing the United Nations, the excuse of the inadequacy of the world Organization must be removed once and for all by its improvement.

We have the responsibility to assure for present and future generations that the spaceship, earth, has an adequately instrumented guidance centre to direct it through the trying, yet creative, days that lie before us. And what is that global guidance centre, if not this United Nations?

I should like to conclude this statement with a brief tribute to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, whose term of office ends in December this year. He has done an outstanding job at an extremely difficult time in the life of the United Nationsa time, as I have noted, of disenchantment and even of antagonism towards the Organization, and a time, moreover, of portentous change, marking a far-reaching shift in emphasis from political confrontations between great Powers to an economic dialogue between the rich and the poor nations which could shape the future of our world. As he has correctly observed: ""Although East-West problems persist in many fields, the North-South relationship is in one form or another increasingly the basic theme of our debates"". [A/31/1/Add.1, sect. II]. While effectively practising ""quiet diplomacy""he is a quiet manto forestall violence in southern Africa, to maintain the precarious peace in Cyprus and in the Middle East, and to damp down dangerous tensions in other places, the Secretary-General has also performed invaluable service in facilitating the crucial dialogue on the new international economic order. The key office of Secretary-General could not have been placed in better hands during this time of historic change and transition. In our estimation, Secretary-General Waldheim deserves to be highly commended for a difficult job well done."	1976-10-01
Imelda R. Marcos	UNGA 32	"Mr. President, allow me first of all to extend to you the felicitations of my delegation on your highly-deserved election to the presidency of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly. Your distinguished career as a diplomat in the service of your country, in advancing the principle of non-alignment and in developing constructive co-operation in the United Nations is the surest guarantee that the General Assembly will have the benefit of wise and effective leadership.


Permit me also to express our profound appreciation of the services of your predecessor, Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe, who steered this Assembly wisely and well under trying circumstances.


And to Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim we pay our sincere tribute for his numerous initiatives in the cause of peace.


We warmly welcome the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti to our midst and extend to them the assurance of our friendly co-operation. The Philippines became one of the sponsors of the resolution on the admission of Viet Nam as a sincere expression of our belief that the heroic people of Viet Nam has much to contribute to the peace and stability of South-East Asia and the world.


The world today is marked by confusion and contradiction. There are reasons for hope amid portents of disaster. There have been dialogue and confrontation, challenge and conciliation.


Plans for peace and the settlement of old conflicts are being patiently worked out in Namibia and Zimbabwe, while wars and threats of war overshadow other parts of Africa and Western and Eastern Asia.


In the Middle East, the Philippines is following with guarded optimism the progress of the effort to reconvene the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East for the resumption of negotiations on the protracted conflict. A new spirit of conciliation and accommodation seems to move all parties to the dispute. We hope that enduring peace can finally be restored to this anguished region.


In another field, the industrialized countries are trying to maintain the momentum of their economic recovery, while the developing countries stagger and sink to their knees under a burden of debt now amounting to about $200 billion.


And in yet another sector, a European conference next month will review the progress in the implementation of the Helsinki accords. Today we seek to ask: is respect for human rights growing or withering away? Are detente and world security threatened by the development of more powerful and more accurate weapons of destruction? In sum, is our common condition getting better or is it getting worse?


The answers must be tentative and conjectural. They are likely to be contradictory and confusing, as, indeed, they have always been. But our attention may be profitably engaged in a recent development that promises to give this session a new and positive significance. This, we hope, is the changing attitude of nations towards one another.


In the past, as we well know, the General Assembly has been driven by partisan passion, the early ideological conflict between the East and the West, the rise to undoubted influence in this Assembly of a massive number of small nations, and more recently, the demand for a new international economic order, pitting as it were, North against South. All have fostered a spirit of intransigence and intolerance which hindered the common search for generally acceptable solutions to world problems.


There was, perhaps, a certain shortness of vision in mustering the so-called automatic majorities, as well as in the disdainful dismissal by the great Powers of the decisions made by those majorities. There was a marked attitude which implied that what the leaders and spokesmen of Asia, Africa and Latin America demanded was of little account, since the fate of the world would hinge, in the last analysis, on the security of the Western democracies and those cultural values that they had nurtured through many centuries.


It is fair to point out that there has now been a hopeful change in that attitude. It has not yet become general, but one may hope that it will spread. There is no doubt that there are those who will look askance at the moral basis of the foreign policy proclaimed by the new administration in the United States of America. I, for one, welcome it because it reinforces my advocacy two years ago, in this very chamber, of an international code of ethics which might restrain ambition and greed.


Of more immediate importance, however, is the unprecedented interest, understanding and sympathy which now apparently pervade American foreign policy under the leadership of President Carter with regard to the developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. It is not unwarranted to sense in this policy a lively desire to devote closer attention to the problems of the developing countries.


We need no longer emphasize that developing countries do matter, that the Asian, African and Latin American nations and peoples can neither be ignored nor dismissed as of no account, or their problems swept under the carpet.


The willingness to be involved on the part of the Western democracies was apparent in their meaningful high-level participation in the recent United Nations meetings on apartheid and racial discrimination, and even more positively, in the initiatives taken to achieve independence for Namibia and propose a settlement in Zimbabwewhich should fully and fairly satisfy the demands of the majority for emancipation and equality.


This multilateral effort of consultation and negotiation with all the existing forces inside and outside the country, and with concerned countries on its borders, on as near a basis of equality as possible, is a real and historic break from the past. We no longer have here an imperial condescension imposing the quick miracle of a unilateral decision. We find instead a sincere search for partnership in the common quest for peace and equalityindeed, for peace through equality.


The Soviet Union and other socialist countries have consistently shown their support for the elimination of all forms of discrimination, oppression and exploitation. For its part, the People's Republic of China has always identified itself as one of the developing countries. By the same token, I trust the developing countries will welcome such a change of attitude in the Western democracies, and its consequent reinforcement of a movement in which they have played an active part. This development is surely a contribution to world peace.


Unfortunately there is another aspect to this interest in the developing countries, and that is why I say these are confusing and contradictory times.


To begin with, we know how nations of the developing world are severely hampered in improving their conditions and in attaining even a modicum of development by existing arrangements in the international economy. It is not even possible to forecast the most modest improvement of the situation unless fundamental adjustments are made in the international economic order. These urgently and desperately needed adjustments will never be achieved if the industrialized countries maintain rigidly defensive positions. The results of the Paris meetings were disappointing, even depressing, for the developing countries.


Similarly, a successful conclusion of the current negotiations on the law of the sea is of vital importance as we move towards the civilization of the future, which will be based on the cultures shaped by the oceans and the seas. For, as global land resources diminish in relation to expanding population, mankind must turn to the seas for life. Ultimately, the survival of mankind will depend on a rational and peaceful use of the sea, and the sea-bed and its resources. But the Conference on the Law of the Sea has yet to agree on rules that would ensure that the vast oceans and seas of the world do not breed conflict and strife but instead serve to link and unify nations and peoples.


Yet the inescapable truth is that we, the developing countries, must work out our own salvation. What the industrialized countries do or fail to do may help or hinder, but in the end the solution to our problems lies mainly in our hands.


The Philippine experience during this decade is, I believe, a demonstration of one people's determination to be self-reliant, to develop as it will, to make friends as it sees fit and to participate in such endeavours of national reconstruction as will specifically promote national and global interests.


As a developing countryin population seventeenth in the world, with a population of 44 million inhabitantsthe Philippines has striven and is still striving to give our people, under the leadership of President Marcos, a social structure and a politico-economic system that will guarantee them the basic human rights: the right to life, to self-fulfilment, to self-determination and to equality, and to emancipation from the feudal and oligarchic oppressions of the past.


The civil administration and constitutional Government of President Marcos can proudly stand on its record of political stability, economic development, law enforcement, social progress and respect for human rights.


In our international relations we have assiduously fostered relations of friendship and co-operation with our neighbours in the Association of South East Asian Nations.


In various parts of the world today other regional communities express the desire of neighbouring or kindred nations to co-operate for peace and progress. These communities, particularly those specifically concerned with economic and social goals, are important touchstones in the development of a world society.


Negotiations at the level of regional associations must help to promote conciliation between North and South and thus create momentum for authentic internationalism.


What goes on at the regional geographic level occurs also in many sectors of international activity. Specialized agencies of the United Nations are performing essential tasks quietly but effectively. Specific concerns such as the environment, the children of the world, desertification and food and famine have brought nations together in common programmes of action, even though their national interests do not always coincide in other areas of endeavour.


Significantly, these meetings and conferences have gathered in many widely scattered placesin Stockholm, Nairobi, Bucharest, Belgrade, Helsinki, Paris, Caracas and Mexico City. In Manila, we were happy to play host to the joint meeting of IMF and the World Bank, the 1977 sessions of the World Food Council and the UNICEF Executive Board and, before that, to the Group of 77. Does this not suggest that perhaps peoples and Governments will find it easier to attain mutual understanding and agreement when their representatives acquire familiarity with the way in which other people live, with the conditions in which other Governments function?


The issue of human rights, for instance, has recently been endowed with special importance. Yet this issue is incredibly complicated by the infinite varieties of time, geography, history, culture and other circumstances and by differing hierarchies of values among nations. It is only through actual knowledge and experience of these factors that an enlightened understanding can be reached.


Surely that is why the rules of procedure of the General Assembly provide that the General Assembly can be convened anywhere in the world. So far, it has met only in Europe and in the United States. Would it not be possiblewould it not be helpful, evenif it met on occasion somewhere in the third world?


If memory does not betray us, the Security Council met in Panama City some time ago, and it is not mere conjecture that this meeting within sight of the physical issue in controversy may have eventually led to the successful conclusion of the negotiations on the Canal.


Who knows what subtle influence might be exercised on our deliberations if the General Assembly were to consider the question of nuclear proliferation in Hiroshima? Or the Palestinian problem in Gaza? Or the problem of famine and food resources in the Sahel? Or the issue of apartheid in Soweto?


My country does not have such tragic memories or such agonizing issues. But it is a country of the third world, which is a microcosm, an archetype, of its problemsthe fair and efficient distribution of land and other resources among an expanding population, the choice between immediate industrialization and the assurance of an adequate food supply, the inadequate employment and consequent disillusionment and discontent of its youth, the balance between authority and indiscipline, individual rights and social obligations.


It is a country where the General Assembly may see for itself what is meant by the third world. Perhaps we may get the feel of its problems at first hand while enjoying the most modern facilities and comforts which the work of the General Assembly and its Secretariat requires for maximum efficiency.


And so I shall conclude with a modest but nonetheless sincere and earnest proposal to invite the General Assembly through you, Mr. President, to hold its thirty-third Session in Manila, of which I am privileged to be the humble Governor. You shall be most welcomeand more than welcomeI assure you.


For us it will be a matter of national pride. But it will be more than that. It will be, I trust, an opportunity for the General Assembly to move, for once, and perhaps many times again, from the towers and palaces of the great Powers to the frontiers of that other world, the third world, which, after all, most of us represent and with whose problems we are most exercised.


For, ultimately, we are concerned with knowing one another, understanding one another's problems and becoming involved in their solution. We can do so most successfully in one another's homes.


Mr. President, on behalf, therefore, of President Marcos and the Filipino people, may I invite you all to our home, Manila."	1977-09-30
Carlos P. Romulo	UNGA 33	"The great English writer, Charles Dickens, began one of his celebrated novels thus: ""It was the best of times; it was the worst of times .. ,"". I suggest that these words form the theme of this session of the General Assembly. But I should amend them to read that if this is not the worst of times, it is also not the best

of times.


At every session of the Assembly, we do in fact hover between the brink of hope and the abyss of despair in a recurrent schizoid pattern symbolic of the profound readjustments in the ongoing relations among nations. Reduced to the simplest level, the problems which face this Assembly can be described as the struggle for supremacy among the ""haves"", and the struggle for equality between the ""haves"" and the ""have-nots"". But the two are not unrelated since the consequences of one impinge on the other and suggest strongly that it is not nations but rather

issues which are interdependent.


We open this, the thirty-third session of the General Assembly, in the afterglow of the agreements on the Middle East reached at Camp David. One of the most intractable and danger-fraught questions of our century may have been moved substantially toward a solution as the result of the extraordinary leadership and personal skill of the President of the United States, Mr. Jimmy Carter. Great credit is also due to the President of Egypt, Mr. Anwar EI-Sadat and the Prime Minister of Israel, Mr. Menachem Begin, whose goodwill and earnestness enabled them to discover their common interest in the search for lasting peace. As truth every breakthrough, how it is pursued will determine its ultimate fruits. It is our earnest hope that the road which led to Camp David shall in the future lead to the final healing of wounds caused by a full generation of unremitting confrontation in the Middle East.


But we should note two things about the Camp David agreementsthe first with pleasure and the second with caution. The first is that the spirit of Camp David reflects the spirit of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and in that respect proves the validity and wisdom of that resolution. The second is that the Camp David agreements do not represent a final settlement, but rather a necessary framework. 


The same note of guarded optimism applies to the situation in black Africa as a whole, with the exceptions of the intractable problems in Zimbabwe and Namibia. Although agreements have been reached in principle, these have not notably diminished tensions. 


In Asia, the signing of the Treaty of Friendship between Japan and the People's Republic of China has added a new dimension to efforts to strengthen the stability of the region. At the same time it has aroused misgivings in some quarters, raising the possibility of fresh tensions in the future. 


Of more proximate interest to the Philippines and to its partners in the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] are the conflicts which, unexpectedly as well as dangerously, have flared into armed skirmishes in our region. We feel that these should be settled as quickly as possible at the negotiating table on terms mutually acceptable to the parties concerned. Within ASEAN itself progress has accelerated markedly in the past year, both in terms of regional economic co-operation and in increased political cohesion. The external relations of ASEAN have also progressed in satisfactory fashion with additional prospects for further co-operation with other countries and international organizations. 


But this Assembly is faced with two persistent problems which concern the whole of mankind. The first is the problem of disarmament, and the second is the North-South dialogue, most fittingly exemplified in the quest for a New International Economic Order. 


The apparent lack of progress in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the principal actors in the nuclear drama is the dramatic symbol of the hazards which confront us daily. While the talks continue to lag, vast sums of money are being spent in the development of another generation of weapons infinitely more sophisticated and therefore more deadly than the older engines of destruction. 


Admitting that disarmament is a slow process, there still are a number of confidence-building measures which could be taken in an effort to halt the runaway race for arms superiority.


Last year 1 proposed three measures which could lead to the establishment of a climate of trust among the nuclear powers. Because they continue to be relevant today, I reiterate them now: first, the achievement of the longsought comprehensive nuclear test ban among Governments willing to participate; secondly, an ancillary moratorium on the testing or use of non-weapon nuclear devices pending the completion of a comprehensive study of their impact on the nuclear-arms race; thirdly, an agreement among major weapons-supplying nations to reduce, progressively and in a balanced manner, the conventional arms race. 


At the same time, more direct measures could be taken once a climate of confidence had been established based on the principle of reciprocal initiatives in which an initiative by one party could be reciprocated in kind by the other parties. 


The following measures deserve to be examined: first, an undertaking not to produce or deploy new weapons systems, which add a new dimension of escalation to the nuclear-arms race, as has been the case, for instance, with multiple missiles; secondly, an announcement that the most lethal chemical weapons, the dreaded nerve gases, would be removed from stockpiles, destroyed and no longer produced; thirdly, a moratorium on the production of fissionable material for weapons purposes, and a reduction of stockpiles; fourthly, a percentage or quantitative reduction in military budgets, nuclear-weapons stockpiles and delivery systems; and fifthly, an undertaking to suspend sales and delivery of nuclear reprocessing plants which have the capability for concentration of weapons-grade material, and to forgo such arrangements in the future. 


The need for confidence- building measures was nowhere more evident than at the tenth special session, on disarmament. It was not a total loss, for it reaffirmed the principle that, since disarmament is a global problem, the proper venue for discussions is the General Assembly. It also resulted in the creation of a committee, now in session in Geneva, to study the question of the reallocation of savings from disarmament to the establishment of a New International Economic Order. Such a study should dramatize, and, it is hoped, convince the nuclear club of, the enormous waste of resources devoted to the mission of death which could be applied to the nobler purpose of enhancing life. 


The connection between disarmament and a New International Economic Order is not accidental, for the restructuring of the world economic system is itself a central preoccupation of mankind. Yet progress is slow. Since the landmark sixth special session on this subject, a fundamental resistance to changes in world economic relations has begun to resurface, which leads to the painful suspicion that in fact the developed countries are impeding the progress of the dialogue in an effort to maintain the status quo.


To the developing countries this position is incomprehensible. The desideratum is to establish a just balance in the interest of both developed and developing countries. The goal is not to rob the rich to pay the poor, but to create international mechanisms for the redistribution of growth opportunities. Since the developing countries are an integral part of the human community and their economic progress or decline affects the whole, it is not only fair but prudent to allow them to participate actively in the processes of economic decision-making which affect the whole world.


While a certain amount of disruption in the economic systems of the developed countries is to be expected, the developing countries feel that the costs of such disruption are far outweighed by the profits of accommodation. Surely the rise of the third world is the principal and most dramatic historical event of the last quarter of this century. Its requirements can be ignored only at the peril of world peace.


If world interdependence is to acquire real meaning it must be based on equality, fairness and justice. Interdependence based on the status quo perpetuates the relationship of dependency between developed and developing countries. While assistance and resource transfers are welcome, they are interim measures and do not constitute a solid basis for the continued growth and progress of developing countries. What is needed, and needed urgently, is a restructuring of the existing system to permit the equitable sharing of world economic growth.


The heart of the two problems of disarmament and of the North-South dialogue lies in the most elemental human right, the right to survive. Nothing more vividly illustrates the mortal danger to the human race than the prospect of a nuclear holocausta prospect that will continue to haunt mankind as long as the arms race continues. 


But there are other, less apocalyptic, dangers. The prospect of creeping death from disease, malnutrition or outright starvation is, if not as dramatic in impact, as surely fatal for the future of mankind.


Though these two problems differ in degree, they are both aspects of human rights. Yet how many of us, seated complacently before our colour television sets, eating instant television dinners, understand what it means to be deprived of food and shelter or to await inevitable death without the necessary medical attention? A 10 cent increase in the price of meat can cause a food riot in an affluent metropolis, yet the absence of meat, and indeed of food of any kind, in deprived areas causes hardly a ripple of concern among the same citizens. 


Everyone in this Assembly subscribes to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; nobody can doubt that, although it is a matter for regret that some have delayed ratification of the implementing Covenants. What is in question is not so much human rights as the priority of choice in the hierarchy of human rights. 


Any Government worthy of the name will accord priority to the preservation of human life. This does not mean forswearing the other human rights; it means relegating them to their appropriate place in the scale of that society's values. For most of us the ideal remains the promotion of human rights coextensively. But few societies would be able to do this even in the best of all possible worlds.


The fact is that we remain prisoners of the ideals of the nineteenth century. Emotionally and intellectually we reject the lessons of the great revolution of our own time, for the revolution of the third world requires adjustments, not in our ideals, but in priorities made necessary by inevitable constraints. 


Yet it should be obvious that civil and political rights cannot flourish in an environment of economic and social deprivation. Indeed, economic and social progress is the necessary pre-condition for the growth of civil and political rights. There is no more eloquent testimony to this fact than the history of the developed countries. I dare say that if human rights, in the restricted meaning current today, had been applied in an inflexible manner one or two centuries ago in those now advanced countries which were then struggling with the critical problems of survival--just as the third world is struggling todaymost nations now advanced would have remained not nations but fragmented tribes. 


The ideal of human rights is hardly new. It was there, just as was the Pacific before Magellan braved its vast waters. But the confused emphasis on human rights today raises serious questions, and I ask them. Are we interested in human rights as such, or are we interested in human rights for their presumed political utility? If human rights are intended to apply to the length and breadth of our planet, why are some countries singled out as alleged ""violators"" while others are conveniently ignored? If it is accepted that the seed-bed of civil and political rights is economic and social progress, how is it possible to explain the sudden and unpredictable withholding or withdrawal of assistance which impeded the development of the very rights economic aid is intended to promote?


And who among us, I ask, is without sin in respect of human rights? Who among us? Let us look at the mote in our eyes and reflect that, in the name of public order, civil and political rights are periodically violated in the very societies which champion the cause of human rights.


But one should not condemn too quickly the regulation of civil and political rights when this is rendered necessary by the need of the community to defend itself from the depredations of a few. To give free rein to the nihilist few in the name of human rights would mean the ultimate folly of collective suicide. In war every country defends itself through extraordinary measures. Today many countries find themselves fighting internal wars as desperate and real as the traditional wars between nation-States. These are wars against terrorists and subversives and separatists. wars against the scourges of hunger, social and economic deprivation and stagnation, illiteracy, pestilence. To overcome these extraordinary adversaries each country must calculate and apply the right blend of extraordinary measures that will be effective in protecting and promote the wellbeing of the majority without  tearing apart the entire social fabric. It is not only possible but essential to construct such carefully calibrated measures, and those compelled to devise them act in the highest interest of human rights and rational conduct.


We inhabit a plural universe and must learn to accept the diversity of customs, values and specific sets of economic and political circumstances. To compel other nations to conform to another country's values is itself an unpardonable violation of human rights. With some justification, many of us begin to wonder if a subtle form of exerting leverage is on the rise and whether the show-the-flag diplomacy of another era is being revived in the name of morality. The great pity is that naked intervention in other people's affairs could ultimately rob the noble ideal of human rights of any true worth or meaning.


In the increasingly interdependent world we live in, we must constantly be on guard against confusing interdependence with interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States. One is as healthy and desirable as the other is reprehensible and unacceptable. Today interference may take many subtle forms, from supranational crusades for causes that on their face are altruistic to gestures of helpfulness that sometimes blur the line between goodwill and good faith on one side and undue, if well-intentioned, meddling on the other. The climate of interdependence can flourish only where nation-States are secure and strong in their sense of independence. Then they can interact with others in confidence and serenity.


Mr. President, we face a crowded and multifaceted agenda at this thirty-third session of the General Assembly. We are fortunate that, through the next three months of intensive work that lie ahead, this Assembly will be steered by one such as you, who is so rich in experience, patience and wisdom. Thus, Sir, in offering you my congratulations and those of the Philippine delegation on the occasion of your election to the presidency of this session, I also congratulate the Assembly on its good fortune in having you at the helm.


Inasmuch as the work of the United Nations is a saga of continuity, I believe I express the general sentiment when I say that we approach our new tasks with confidence and buoyant spirits because of what we accomplished last year WIder the able leadership of our past President, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, who guided us through unprecedented multiple sessions with great skill, serenity and goodwill, and the momentum generated under his stewardship will prove

useful to all of us at this session.


The Philippines happily associates itself with the remarks of welcome that have been addressed to Solomon Islands on the occasion of its accession to membership in the United Nations. It was our privilege to be one of the sponsors of its membership, and this adds a special sense of satisfaction to the fond welcome that we extend to our newest nation-colleague and coworker in the unceasing effort to build a better and happier world.


May I also be allowed to say that the Assembly once again finds itself hugely in debt to Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim for the substantive report that he has written for our thirty-third session [A/33/1]. This report is a model of conciseness, clarity, perceptiveness and realism, leavened with hope, faith and confidence. It logs what we have done and where we have been as clearly and crisply as it charts the course we are on and the various directions we may opt for. I wish to single out his statesmanlike reference to spheres of influence, and particularly his wise counsel that we should not expect instant and total solutions to our problems, or dramatic results from all our plans and programmes. I agree with him that it is cause enough for thanks and rejoicing that we constantly move forward and make progresssubstantial if possible, modest if that is all that is possibletowards our goals and ideals. The important thing is that we never give up trying, working and striving to construct the best of all possible worlds and bring about the best of all possible times for all mankind. Mr. Secretary-General, we are beholden to you, and you have our profound gratitude."	1978-09-26
Carlos P. Romulo	UNGA 34	"Mr. President, it is with a deep sense ofsatisfaction that I add my voice to the swelling chorus of congratulations on your election as President. With your election the world affirms the validity of the United Nations as the parliament of man, where every nation, weak or strong, rich or poor, stands equal before all the rest. With your election the world honours Afnca, which has long been, and still is, a symbol of the continuing struggle against racism. 


You have long stood on the ramparts of that struggle. The Philippines, I am proud to say, has stood and will continue to stand side by side with you in fighting for this noble cause. We wish you every success. 


More than 2,000 years ago, the greatest of Greek historians, Thucydides, provided mankind with some ofthe deepest insights ever given into the nature of the human condition and of relations among men. In this effort he has not been surpassed; the lessons of the Peloponnesian wars are as relevant to our times as they were to his troubled era. The causes of human conflict, he said, are rooted in the motives of fallible man. But the management of conflict depends on the faint spark of wisdom which, as a gift of the gods, inherent in the very frailty of mankind.


It is not inappropriate to recall this thought at this time, for while the correspondence between the world of ancient Greece and ours is not exact, Thucydides provides us with an ancient guideline to the management of modern conflicts in our complex era.


Last year in this Assembly, there was general agreement on the complex nature of the present world. Three things stood out. The first was a scrupulous avoidance ofdirect confrontation among the great Powers. The second was the diminution of ideology and a renewal of emphasis on national interests. The third was a shift from military competition to economic competition.


All these were, as we saw them, hopeful signs ofa better and more peaceful world to come. Some began to think it possible for mankind some day to be free from the ever present threat ofwar. We chose to read in these signs the beginning of an age when all mankind would be guaranteed its basic needs.


But gifts are not always all good. The bitter comes with the sweet; thorns hide among the most fragrant flowers. The encouraging trends which we noted last year are still there, but along with them are the unwelcome. If we were to portray the world today, the following would stand out: first, the revival of wars by proxy as an alternative to direct confrontation; secondly, and as a corollary to the first, the exploitation of the instabilities in many third-world countries; thirdly, the pursuit of national interests at the expense of weaker States; fourthly, the growing alarm at the possible fragmentation of the world into political and economic spheres of influence.


As our discussions in this Assembly proceed, we cannot ignore these trends which, unless arrested, will certainly pose new threats to world peace and stability. The great Powers in particular bear a heavy share ofthe responsibility for their solution. We invite the Super Powers to assist in this search.


In connection with the items in this year's agenda, we note with necessary caution the progress achieved in the corollary disarmament studies that are at present under way as a result ofthe mandate ofthe tenth special session, held on disarmament. On the question of disarmament itself, we view with continuing regret the profound inability of the human community to come to grips with what is at the heart ofthe problem. Even onthe question of arms control, there has been no progress and, indeed, very little constructive discussion. While recognizing the difficulties of a practical and technical character in arms control agreements, we should always keep in view the unassailable fact that the larger interests ofmankind, particularly its survival, outweigh all other considerations. The life of a single human being has a value far above the mightiest arsenal in the world. But we think so little of humanity that we persist in the mindless pursuit of our destruction.


We welcome the signing ofthe agreement reached at the conclusion of the second round of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) in full expectation that it will lead to a reduction of current world tensions. We hope further that this measure will be followed by a succession of other agreements, including a complete pan on the testing of nuclear weapons.


In the Middle East, much has been accomplished to pave the way to a solution of this generations-old problem. Yet the fabric of peace in that troubled land continues to be fragile. We maintain the view that, unless the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people is upheld, the chances for durable and comprehensive answers to one of the most puzzling riddles of our time will be diminished.


A groot statesman once said that compromise does not necessarily mean a concession. If a memorable dictum was ever out of place, that surely is the case in relation to the Middle East. In our view, the needed compromise has been set by the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, and they remain the guidelines for solving once and for all a problem which, unless solved, will continue to bear grave implications for the peace of the entire world.


Africa south of the Sahara is still to be a stormcentre of unrest. It will continue to be so until the universally accepted principle of rule by the consent of the majority is accepted in precept and in practice and until the evil of rampant racism is removed from its midst. The problem ofSouth Africa appears obdurately resistant to solution, and a parallel situation is found in Namibia. South Africa remains beyond the pale, a moral outcast from the community of nations and from peoples everywhere, who hold fast to the norms of human decency and respect for the dignity ofthe human Person.


We are at a crucial juncture in our march to economic and social progress. Since the founding ofthe United Nations, never has there been such disparityin the living standards of peoples and in the wealth of nations. The data of 1978 tell us that nearly 2.5 billion people-the population of 74 countries, or 60 per cent of the world's population-are classified as poor. Only 32 countries with a total population of only 645 million--or 16 per cent of the world's total-are considered rich and have per capita incomes ranging from $US 5,000 to $US 15,000. For the peoples ofthe poorest 20 countries with about 6 percent ofthe world's population, or 260 million people it is a question of bare survival, as they are subsisting on per capita incomes averaging 5 per cent or less ofthose ofthe rich countries. Yet there is so much wealth in the world, wealth so heavily concentrated in a minority of rich countries, that grinding poverty and hunger need not stalk so many lands. Indeed, this is the irony-and tragedy of our times.


During the year, the Special Committee on the Charter ofthe Umted Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization continued its work towards fulfillment of its mandate to list proposals for the improvement of the United Nations, identifying those which awaken special interest for later action by the General Assembly or other appropriate bodies. The potential usefulness of that Committee is high, and its value can be very great, depending upon the interest of the Members and their seriousness in implementing steps to improve our world Organization.


I now wish to invite your attention to our own corner of the world. For the last several years, the greatest single concern of my country and our partners In the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has been to encourage a balance among the Powers in the region, as well as among external Powers with interests in the area. There are two fundamental reasons behind this effort. First, we wished to avoid a situation in which rivalry among the Powers with ambitions for undue predominance in the region would involve our countnes in such an ambition or embroil us in other people's wars. And, secondly, we wished to improve the climate within which our countries--generously described as the area with the greatest potential for development-could attain our ambitions of economic development and political and social cohesiveness.


I can say with pardonable pride for my own country and without undue presumption also for our ASEAN partners-Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand-that we have advanced far towards our goals. Equally important, our individual progress has benefited from the collective effort; the past year particularly has seen the growth of a tangible unity among us and an increasingly common stand in our relations with the rest of the world.


The context of our common efforts in the region has, unfortunately, taken a turn for the worse. We never did entertain any illusions that the onset of a balance of power in Asia, as well as in South-East Asia, would be tranquil or swift. It was bound to take time, because readjustments in relationships in the wake of the second Indo-Chinese war were likely to be a long and complex process. Indeed, the realignments have been more painful and more fateful than anyone expected. The stark underlying fact of life in South-East Asia today with dire implications for us and most assuredly the rest of the world, is the build-up of the rivalry among the great Powers, but particularly. the Sino-Soviet nvalry. It has oflate reintroduced tensions fully as dangerous in their consequences as any that have ever existed in the region. We simply seek to state a fact and trace its consequences, not to impute any motives. The Philippines is and will remain a friend to all parties involved. Neither do we say that the events that we speak of are wholly to be a~cribed to this rivalry. The tracing of cause and effect IS never a complete process in human affairs, but that such a rivalry did play an important part in or behind these events seems to be an inescapable conclusion.


Two equally disturbing developments began this year. The first Was the armed intervention in Kampuchea. Profoundly disturbed by this break-down of peace in South-East Asia, ASEAN immediately issued a joint statement in Bangkok expressing its serious concern at the armed intervention in the internal affairs of another country and affinning the right ofthe people of Kampuchea to determine for themselves the form of government which they desired. This statement became the substance of a draft resolution introduced in the Securitr Council by friends in the non-aligned group of nations. Though defeated by veto, the draft resolution was supported by all but two members of the Council. The statement was reaffinned by the Foreign Ministers of ASEAN at their subsequent meeting in Bali.


The second development is the unceasing flow of refugees from the Indo-Chinese countries. By land and sea, men, women and children fled lndo-China in countless droves: many to their death, most to a life of uncertainty and deprivation, to a temporary though safe haven in makeshift camps in countries barely able to support them.


No event in recent memory has so stirred-as it stilI does-the conscience of the world as the plight of these refugees. Among them are the boat people. Believing in a better life elsewhere theY risk life itself by setting out in unseaworthy boats for destinations they know hardly anything about. The estimates ofthe numbers ofthose who did not make it run into the hundreds of thousands and this must horrify all of us. Just as in the case of mass involuntary movements elsewhere in the world, how long can mankind live with such instances of man's inhumanity to man?


But the suffering ofthe refugees is only halfofthe story. There is the other side ofthe picture-the misery and the serious social, economic and political repercussions on the countries of first asylum, the majority of which belong to ASEAN.


This was why all the ASEAN countries responded speedily and gratefully to the Secretary-Generals call for an international conference in Geneva earlIer thIS year. At that Meeting President Marcos of the Philippines offered to house 50,000 ofthose refugees who had already been accepted for resettlement. In addition on a similar offer also made by him and subject to Similar conditions-namely, that they will be funded by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other interested parties, and that we shall not be saddIed with residuals-the Philippines will be in a position to provide temporary shelter to a total of 60,000 IndoChmese refugees.


In the East we say that what affects my brother affects me equally, that indeed we are our brother skeeper. Although we cannot be more than a country of first asylum, although we cannot risk our development at the present stage by assuming the burden of refugees, President Marcos made these two offers in the ASEAN spirit of assisting another at a time of great need. We made the offers because we feel strongly that the spirit of humanitarianism should prevail, and because we wished specially to recognize the fact that the right of survival IS the most basic of human rights.


We await the Secretary-General's report on the refugee question this session with particular anxiety because a second generation of problems may soon be upon us. The rampant country-wide famine in Kampuchea; the possibility of the revival of conflict in that country with the end ofthe monsoon season; the threat of another massive tide of refugees as a result of both war and famine-these are problems which we cannot dismiss lightly and whose consequences, unless we act in time, can be far more terrible than we dare to imagine.


I cannot close this statement without paying a tribute to the unceasing and unfaltering efforts of the Secretary-General to uphold the validity of the United Nations Ideal in the face ofgrowing odds, to increase its potency and improve its efficiency in solving the world's problems, and in bringing these efforts to bear on the flashpoints that threaten everywhere the flowering of what he calls ""a global civilization and order unprecedentedly wide in its scope and diversity"" [see A/34/1, sect. XIII]. .


In the name of my country we salute the Secretary-General for his report on the work of the Organization, a report which clearly demonstrates the breadth and scope of his insights into what ails the human community today and-despite the commanding heights from which he views the human conditionfor his grasp of the problems on the ground, among them the multifarious concerns of running an Organization that now includes 152 nations, a host of special instruments and even armies in the field. I must commend the Secretary-General for his report, a report which must be read by all members of this Assembly if they are to be loyal to their trust, a masterful document which I feel deserves to be read by all the peoples ofthe world, so that every man, woman and child whose lives are affected by public events can share the spirit that animates our United Nations.


All of us are indebted to the Secretary-General for presenting an excellent summary of what should concern all of us. He has outlined specific problems of instability, poverty and economic weakness in various regions and we are gratified by the prominent place he gives to the New International Economic Order, UNCTAD, the North-South dialogue, the Indo-China situation, the refugees, the law ofthe sea and the energy and global interests, and without such an institution, we are all in peril.


Because we are facing perilous times, the Secretary-General holds an office unique in the annals of mankind, for never has one office had the influence and the responsibility to mould human affairs on such a global scale and to convert the potential contained in the coming together of mankind into a force that solves rather than palliates human problems. The world wishes him well."	1979-09-25
Carlos P. Romulo	UNGA 35	"My delegation joins our colleagues in congratulating you, Sir, on your unanimous election as President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Your election is a tribute to your sterling personal qualities and an honour to your great country. whose role. In the international community has been marked by vision, imagination and dynamismdedicated to the cause of peace in a difficult passage in the history of our time.


In its wise choice of Mr. van Wechmar, the United Nations has come full circle. A distinguished citizen of an ""enemy State"" has been elected to guide the deliberations of the Organization at a time when our overriding need is to moderate conflicts and shape the contours of reality in conformity with our desire for peace.


There is a trace of irony in this situation, for years my delegation has pleaded for the removal of all references to ""enemy States"" from the Charter of the United Nations. However noble the Charter is--and no one disputes this--it is not without its flaws, and this is surely one of the most glaring. Today we are doubly happy. In an indirect way we feel vindicated in our quest, and we are certain that Our new President will reflect those qualities which have made his nation one of the strongest pillars of the house of peace which we are all trying to build.


In this endeavour the outgoing President of the General Assembly, Mr. Salim, has made important contributions which we deeply acknowledge. To him we extend our sincere congratulations.


We welcome the admission of Zimbabwe and St. Vincent and the Grenadines to the world Organization and look forward to their constructive contributions.


In nature, nothing is more constant than the cycle of the seasons. In human affairs, the tides would seem to follow the same cyclical pattern. The brief springtime of detente is over and we face the bleak prospect of another freezing winter of a cold war far more terrifying in its implications for the future of mankind than any that has preceded it in the post-war world.


In the past year, several important questions have continued to be at the forefront of our most serious concerns, The first is the impasse on the issue of arms control, most notably in the limitation of nuclear weapons; in the failure to make progress on the mutual balanced reduction of forces; and in the additional complications on the question for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. The second is the marked lack of momentum in getting the Third United Nations Development Decade under way. And finally there is our inability to provide solutions to brush fires, with their dangerous potential for igniting wars of world-wide proportions.


The history of man's efforts to disarm is a long and troubled one. The same history teaches us that when such efforts fail they inevitably lead to open and tragic conflict. But today's problem is of a different order. Never before have arms been developed in such quantity and with such destructive capability. Regardless of the ingenious and clever scenarios for surviving a nuclear holocaust, no one can dare to assert categorically that civilization itself would survive. No doubt our planet would still be here, but it would be there floating aimlessly in space like a dead star.


Fear is a poor counsellor, but it is just as often a natural alarm system. If we fail to heed this fear then we may be--if we are not already in the midst of it--on the verge of a new and vastly more dangerous arms race on a blind course to global annihilation. My delegation speaks before this Assembly without discouragement but with considerable apprehension. We live today in a continuum in which not one but several cold wars intersect, creating a labyrinth from which we are seemingly unable to extricate ourselves. Harsh facts confront us today, yet the irony is that in a hall intended precisely to harmonize diverse interests the atmosphere of uncertainty envelopes all of us, like a thick fog in which we are unable to find our bearings.


We are victim of our own folly. Man's genius, which has led him to attempt the conquest of space, is applied with equal fervour to self-immolation. The ever-increasing sophistication of high technology appears to dictate our policies rather than, as it should be, the other way around. Unless we can reverse this futile trend, we shall be creating our own doom. For this reason we look forward to the projected exchange of views between the super-Powers with the prayerful hope that they can begin to chart new courses of action to avert the seemingly irresistible tide towards our common destruction.


There is no direct correspondence between arms control and detente; each is supportive of the other. Detente does lead to the development of trust and helps to improve the climate for the peaceful solution of problems. We wish to emphasize, however, that faithful observance of the tacit rules of detente is the first and indispensable requirement for its success. On that basis we would favour the resurrection of the experiment of learning to live together in relative peace. Another requirement, equally indispensable, is that detente should apply on a universal scale. A detente which reduces tensions in one area of the world while creating or exploiting destabilization in other areas, particularly in weaker and more vulnerable countries in the third world, negates the very purposes of detente. Like peace, detente is indivisible.


The eleventh special session of the General Assembly, devoted to economic development, ended on a less than hopeful note. We view the results with extreme regret, for this surely is a problem which affects all countries, large and small. What we need is a crash programme of co-operation on some of the most pressing problems of our time. The painful prospect which faces all of us is that, under the best of circumstances, the growth rate of all countries will decrease in the coming decade in varying degrees. Renewed recession is predictable, and inflation continues to resist solution.


It requires little thought to remind us that the crushing burden will be borne mainly by the developing countries which, again in varying degrees, will have to cope with two of the great crises of our time, shortages in energy and food. As these crises grow, there remains the possibility that the debt explosion will reach unmanageable proportions, introducing instabilities which are bound to affect the developed countries as well. The spiral of uncertainty will turn relations between the developed and developing countries into mutually re-enforcing difficulties; the problems of the South will become part and parcel of the problems of the North, just as today the problems of the North have become the problems of the South. The solutions to the problem, while admittedly not easy, are common tasks which require speedy implementation if we are to avert the dread possibility of disaster, not just for the South but also for the North.


After seven years of arduous negotiations, with a significantly successful session at Geneva last summer, the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is close to the completion of a universal convention establishing a new regime for the seas and their resources, based on the principle of the ""common heritage of mankind"" conceived by the United Nations. The Third Conference successfully hurdled the difficult issue of the exploitation of the sea-bed, and only a few more related issues remain to be discussed at the next session. We strongly hope that the new convention will be signed next year and thus usher in a new regime of international law. My delegation echoes the thought of Secretary-General Waldheim when he described the Third Conference as a ""major achievement"" which provides incontrovertible proof that, where the political will exists, issues of a potentially confrontational character can be resolved peacefully and amicably.


The results of the 1980 session of the Special Committee on the Charter and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization, held at Manila in February this year, demonstrated a determination among Member States of the United Nations to achieve a better congruence between the United Nations system and the realities of the modern world. The Special Committee's work on the question of the peaceful settlement of disputes was particularly encouraging in its consideration of the draft Manila declaration on the peaceful settlement of international disputes [see A/35133, para. 164]. My delegation expresses the hope that an early agreement on the declaration will be reached. It is not an easy task to develop an equilibrium between continuity and change, and we must appreciate the importance of the Committee's efforts in carrying out its responsibilities. The Special Committee has reached a significant stage of its work and it deserves our encouragement and full support.


I turn now to specific issues.


On the question of Palestine, my delegation reiterates its support for the right of self-determination of the Palestinian peoples. In the case of Jerusalem, the unilateral act of annexation by Israel is unduly provocative and has rightly earned the censure of the Security Council by its resolution 478 (1980). In the long history of Arab-Israeli conflict, the city of holy shrines has always been a bone of impassioned contention. The reasons are not far to seek. It is not a question of territorial aggrandizement; nor is it a narrow legal question. It is a question with heavy moral overtones just as important to more than half of mankind as they are to Israel. Toe city is encrusted with layer upon layer of sacred lore to which so many in nearly every corner of the world owe their deepest allegiance.


If any city is international in character, it is certainly Jerusalem. My delegation supports, just as it has in the past, the internationalization of the city. We call upon Israel, recognizing its deep devotion to its own historical past, to recognize in other peoples the same measure of devotion to their own past, which continues to the living present. We call upon Israel to return to the processes of negotiation and heed the repeated injunctions of the Security Council.


On Asia, my delegation wishes to express its deepest concern over the continued conflict in Afghanistan and in Kampuchea. Both arise from the same root cause: they constitute open and flagrant violations of the principle of non-interference and non-intervention in the internal affairs or other countries. In neither case can we condone this act of transgression against one of the most cherished principles of the Charter or the United Nations. Nor can we condone the violation of the right of peoples to determine for themselves the kind of government they want. In both cases, our expressed preference is for political solutions. No other course ls acceptable. The longer the conflicts last, the greater the danger of involvement by other Powers, thus enlarging the threat to world peace and stability.


In concert with our fellow members in ASEAN, we have consistently held the view that the elements of a political solution to the Kampuchean question are contained in General Assembly resolution 34/22 on the subject, namely, the withdrawal of Vietnamese armed forces and the establishment of a neutral and non-aligned Kampuchea.


The urgent need for a political solution in Kampuchea is underlined by the act of aggression perpetrated by Viet Nam against Thailand on the very eve of the thirteenth ASEAN ministerial meeting at Kuala Lumpur on 25 and 26 June. By that single act Viet Nam betrayed the true extent of its ambitions and its total lack of respect for world opinion. We stand by our beleaguered colleague Thailand, and shall continue to give it our full political and moral support.


The grave situation in Kampuchea should not be allowed to deteriorate further. For this reason, the Philippines and its ASEAN partners urge the Assembly to consider on an urgent basis the convening of an international conference on the problem of Kampuchea.


Today, Viet Nam will once again make an effort to unseat the legitimate Government of Kampuchea from the United Nations and install in its place the alleged Government of Heng Samrin. But the Heng Samrin regime is not at Phnom Penh by divine right, nor is it there by political right. It sits in the Kampuchean capital by the grace of the weapons of its master and protector, without whom it is helpless and with whom it wields not an iota of power of its own. If we accept the Heng Samrin regime, then we reward the fruits of aggression. If we accept the Heng Samrin regime, then we legitimize and indeed invite interference in our own internal affairs. If we accept the Heng Samrin regime, then we tolerate the violation of the principle of self-determination.


More than two-thirds of the Members of the United Nations are seated here today because we claimed for ourselves the right of self-determination. We owe it more than lip service; we owe it our most profound respect. For it is this sacred principle which gave birth to us as nations and as independent peoples.


Last year we rejected the credentials of the Heng Samrin regime. Let us do so again this year. I urge all those to who in the Charter is not a mere scrap of paper but the holy writ of our Organization to reject decisively the pretensions of the usurper of Phnom Penh, Nothing has happened since this time last year, when we rejected their credentials to make their claim more valid than it is now. The resolution which this Assembly adopted last year to resolve this issue continues to be ignored. Until the parties concerned evince respect for the collective will of the community of nations we have no choice but to continue to uphold the sovereignty; and the sovereign rights of the legitimate regime, which have been violated by external force.


Let there be no mistake about our motives. We hold no brief for any particular regime, personality, or ideology in this matter. We are one with those who stand back in revulsion at the horrors perpetrated by the Pol Pot regime. But we also believe that we have no right, under present international law, to prescribe what regime should preside over the affairs of the Kampuchean people. That is for them to decide for themselves, freely and without external interference. They have not had that opportunity, which is their right.


Until they have had that opportunity, which is only possible if the United Nations resolution on Kampuchea is strictly implemented, we must stand fast on the principle which is vitally involved in this matter. That is the principle of the inviolability of the sovereignty of States, of their territorial integrity and their right of self-determination.


My delegation wishes to close this brief statement with a tribute to the Secretary-General. The United Nations is our common creation; it is what we want it to be. But the presiding genius who keeps his finger continuously on the pulse of the world situation is the Secretary-General. It is he who perseveres in mediating between the need to keep the principles of the Charter inviolate and the elements of instability inherent in a changing world.


Amidst the cross-currents of the numerous conflicts which sorely beset the world, the Secretary-General remains above the battle. Yet it is his unseen hand that unselfishly guides us in defining problems and in this way assists in the search for solutions. He is a realist; he knows that there are no instant solutions. Yet he remains an idealist; he knows that the true foundation for peace is the development of a sense of human community.


In the effort to reconcile those two elements, he has kept the United Nations together. Indeed, he has done more. Misunderstood and sometimes reviled by the press. The world Organization has gained in strength and effectiveness under Mr. Waldheim. No one can do more: no one can be expected to do more. In this lies his real achievement."	1980-09-23
Carlos P. Romulo	UNGA 36	"Many years ago, I proposed in the Assembly that policy statements should be limited to 20 to 25 minutes. I have attempted and will attempt today to do that. The full text of my speech will be distributed to members of the Assembly. I have an abridged version which I will deliver, and the reading time--I ask members to look at their watches-will not exceed 20 minutes. I hope that this will be emulated by subsequent speakers; We waste too much time in long speeches, when I believe that the full texts can be distributed to the members, who can read them at their leisure in their rooms or apartments.


My delegation is pleased to join our colleagues in congratulating you, Mr. President, and the country which you so ably represent, and in paying a tribute to your wealth of experience and proved diplomatic skill. Having served as an international civil servant in a high capacity, you have an unrivalled knowledge of the vast machinery of the United Nations, a knowledge that we are sure you will share with us in our deliberations during this session.


I acknowledge gratefully our kind reference to me in your opening remarks following your election [1st meeting]. I can only say that if during my term as President.1949, I had had even as a small portion of your mastery of the workings of the Assembly, and if I were younger, I would consider running for President again when Asia's turn next comes round.


Our congratulations also go to the outgoing President, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar. He ran the Assembly with exemplary efficiency and punctuality which we must learn to emulate at this session--and imparted much of his wisdom in the solution of the numerous difficulties which beset the past session, especially in his pioneer work on global negotiations. In his eloquent valedictory address [ibid.], the best ever delivered by any outgoing President of the General Assembly, including myself, he left us a great deal of food for thought and profitable lessons for us all.


In the last 10 years we have noted the changing tone and colour of the relations among nations. Periodic crises, often low-key but more frequently of an emergency character, have continued to occur in the world. Many of these have been solved by time, like a wound that heals itself. But many more remain persistent and chronic, rising and falling in severity in accordance with the unpredictable global political climate.


Today we know that these crises create a cumulative iGipact. At a particular point in time the problems converge and generate intolerable pressures seemingly beyond our power to control. The prospect of a new world order built on the acceptance of reciprocal interests leading to peace, justice and security for all has been an illusory fabric, too frail to bear the burden of our deepest hopes.


We derive a measure of optimism from the fact that in the past we have managed our problems in a way that has kept the world on a reasonably even keel. But it is quite evident that the ""windows of opportunity"" for promoting a stable world order based on tacitly accepted norms of international conduct are at this moment firmly shut. Unless we can reopen those windows--and it is our task to do so--we should all very much fear that, against our will, we shall be writing a prescription for global disaster. Why have we reached this dark passage in the history of our time? I suggest that behind the great issues of arms control, the apparently insoluble dilemmas in the Middle East and the issues of Afghanistan and Kampuchea lie profound psychological causes.


The following elements, among many others, have obvious causal connections with our failure to move ahead. One is deep-seated fears and suspicions. A second is an ineradicable feeling of insecurity. A third is lack of confidence in the viability of a world order capable of sustaining long-term stability. And a fourth is over-dependence on the luck of the gambler for the sake of particularist interests.


It would be ideal to suggest that the foregoing elements-- the hidden and unrecognized causes that move men and nations to action--could be eradicated by a simple act of will. But they can be mitigated by open dialogue or, in word, by communication. It is one of the ironies, of our time that, on a planet shrunk by unbelievable technological advances in communication, the one thing that we have been unable to solve is the act of communication among men in order to bridge the mysterious gap, which can lead to understanding.


The practical consequences of this lack of communication affect all of us and form the main burden of the deliberations of this session. It is in this context that we must view the ominous signs of the revival of the arms race, especially the infinitely sophisticated new generation of nuclear weapons with the power to destroy the world many times over. The efforts to establish an agreed ceiling on the most lethal nuclear arms remain deadlocked, a situation which enlarges the factor of uncertainty and further encourages even higher levels of nuclear-weapon development.


Many times in this forum, we have raised our voices in apprehension that the unimaginable horrors of nuclear war will be visited on mankind with profit to none and loss to all, including those with the power to unleash the weapons of apocalypse. In this grave situation, we must again appeal to the great Powers to begin conversations within a framework which will permit the resumption of agreements on mutually acceptable limits of nuclear weapons. The longer the delay on this most critical issue, the greater are the chances that the rising level of tension will escalate to unacceptable proportions and thus ignite a conflagration which, without question, will incinerate the entire planet.


In this connection, my delegation wishes to invite the attention of the Assembly to the wide-ranging report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization [A/36/1). In his customary fashion, the Secretary-General has drawn for us a faithful picture of our times, full of sharp insights into the human condition and all-encompassing in his range of vision. Only he, as a seasoned diplomat and with his long experience as Secretary-General, could have given us such a statesmanlike report, which should be translated into all languages in order to give the world a correct overall appraisal of the contemporary condition of humankind.


On the subject of the arms race, for example, the Secretary-General has the following to say in his unchallengeable analysis. I hope that the super-Powers will listen to him. He says: ""What is called the problem of the anns race is in reality a complex of problems. The largest single factor fuelling the world-wide arms build-up has for a long time been the hostility between East and West. After a period of relative relaxation, the relations between the super-Powers are again going through a period of tension, and there are clear indications of a sharply intensified upward spiral in their arms build-up."" [lbid. sect. V.]


Those are wise words, words of alarm, words that should alert all of us. The Secretary-General continues a little later: ""From their first appearance in history, the existence of nuclear weapons added a new and frightening dimension to the potentialities for world catastrophe. While the governments concerned have rightly expressed their extreme aversion to using such weapons, their very existence in the tense context of great power relationships constitutes an unprecedented threat for human society and civilization."" [Ibid.] Those are the words of the Secretary-General warning the super-Powers. He continues: ""In international affairs, confusion, confrontation and emotion cannot accurately be foreseen, forestalled or controlled, and a nuclear war would be both devastatingly quick and conclusive'. If the present nuclear arms race among the most powerful States is the greatest potential danger threatening mankind, a similar race between additional nuclear States will add immeasurably to that danger and to the risk of the actual use of nuclear weapons.'' [Ibid.]


Those are words of warning from the man who has been leading us all this time.


Until this issue is resolved, further forward movement on general disarmament in the longer term will be impeded and may indeed put at issue once more the limited gains in the area of collateral measures achieved after lengthy and protracted endeavours. Time is not on our side. We should make every effort to maintain the momentum which can lead to meaningful results in the proposed conference on disarmament to be held early next year.


The spiralling arms race has an obvious connection with the other great issues that face the world today, and which the Secretary-General also emphasizes. I refer to the North-South dialogue. In his farewell address to the Assembly, the outgoing President, Mr. von Wechmar, called attention to the fact that if only 5 per cent of the budget for military expenditures were diverted to economic development, it would provide a solution to the stagnant world economy, particularly the economies of the developing countries [1st meeting, para. 13]. This Slight observation underscores the need to curb the vast sums spent for military hardware and weapons development. The new economics of war-preparedness conflicts with the global demand for higher standards of living and for the even more urgent task of eradicating poverty everywhere. Abundant proof exists that the increasing capacity to wage war not only endangers peace but also dissipates international wealth.


I suggest that this situation is not worth the price that it entails, for it involves grinding poverty and social and political instability, with their predictable adverse consequences for world peace. Many less developed countries are engaged in massive and sustained national efforts to promote growth and eradicate poverty. But a deteriorating external environment for development will make these efforts increasingly difficult, if it does not frustrate them altogether. We wish to emphasize that this is not a one-way street. We must recognize the changed nature of interdependence. The problems of the poor and the rich impinge on each other and cause grave difficulties for both.


In the report of the World Bank in 1981, the developing countries are described as ""engines of growth"" in the world economy. The report makes two important points. Firstly, an increment of 1 per cent in the rate of growth of developing countries would generate significant increases in the development world. Secondly, the sustained efforts by developing countries prevented serious recession and widespread unemployment in the industrialized countries. In our view, this is the operational meaning of interdependence.


Yet the continued depressed condition of the world economy is not necessarily inevitable. Policy choices in key areas fall within the political range of international decision-making. For this reason we look forward with cautious optimism to the informal exchange of views at the futematiJnal Meeting on Co-operation and Development, to be held next month. It may--and could--provide the needed political will to launch the long-delayed global round of negotiations at this session of the Assembly.


Having dealt with those two paramount issues, I tum now to problems of a regional character.


The events of the past year in the Middle East suggest a setback in the continuing efforts to achieve a comprehensive settlement of the interlocking problems which beset the region. In our view, the most important single element is the question, of Palestinian self-determination. Unless and until lsrael modifies its unyielding stand on this issue, violence will continue to rack that part of the world. Israel has a legitimate concern for its security, and the Palestinian Jews must recognize this, but Israel's reactions transcend the limits of that concern. Israel must accept that it cannot aspire to be the paramount power in the region; a just solution requires, within the boundaries of security for all, an equal partnership in peaceful endeavours.


Similar conditions afflict Namibia in southern Africa. It is difficult, in the light of the negotiations of the last few years, to interpret South Africa's intransigent position as anything but delaying tactics to enable it to perpetuate its occupation of Namibia. My delegation is prepared to support once again any initiative by the General Assembly to secure the immediate implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) on the subject and for the imposition of sanctions on South Africa within a specified time-frame.


Within South Africa itself, the racist policies remain unchanged. But it is a measure of the increasingly bold opposition by that country's black majority that violence has demonstrably increased in the past year. The radicalization of oppressed elements is a natural consequence of unceasing repression. South Africa should not be surprised if it finds itself increasingly besieged from within and from without.


In Afghanistan, the prospects for solution remain dim. The Soviet Union has consistently rejected the beginnings of a dialogue which could at the least create a framework withjn which negotiations could take place, leading to the withdrawal of Soviet forces and the exercise of self-determination by the Afghan people. There is no other rational solution to a problem 'Which correctly concerns the whole world, not only because it violates the Charter of the United Nations, but also because it has extensive ramifications which could in time involve other areas of Asia and the Middle East. In the meantime, the Soviet Union is paying an unexpectedly high price in supporting a satellite regime which does not have the support of the Afghan people. For the rest of the world, the violation of the sovereign rights of an independent people by the use of naked force is gross misconduct from which it cannot and should not avert its eyes.


The situation in Kampuchea continues to be a matter of very serious concern. The spurious claims of the restoration of stability in that war-tom country are not home out by the facts. They are false. The situation remains a threat to the peace of the whole of South-East Asia, to all of us in South-East Asia.


Earlier this summer, the International Conference on Kampuchea was convened under the auspices of the United Nations. The major result was a Declaration unanimously adopted by the Conference. The Conference agreed that the key to the Kampuchean problem lies in a comprehensive political settlement. With this end in view, the Declaration calls for negotiations based on four major elements.


It continues to be a matter of regret that Viet Nam and its friends chose to avoid the Conference. The elements for negotiations were offered in open-handed and sincere fashion, and to all observers they were most reasonable ones. But Viet Nam continues to entertain the fiction that the Kampuchean problem lies outside the purview of the United Nations and therefore any action which the Ur.tited Nations might take is, in their words, illegal. This is an untenable proposition. We once again invite Viet Nam to come forward and begin considering serious steps to solve a problem which has increased world instability and caused Viet Nam itself great difficulties.


In another part of Asia, an old problem which still remains a danger deserves fresh examination. Although the question of the re-unification of Korea is not on the agenda of the Assembly, we should take note of the efforts of President Chun to revive the negotiations at the summit level. In view of the lack of response from the North, perhaps the already overburdened Secretary-General could be persuaded in the interest of peace to use his good offices as a channel of communication. In the past we have supported the admission of the two Koreas to the United Nations if it would serve the interests of both. We do so again today.


We cannot stress too strongly our concern with the related issues of Afghanistan and Kampuchea. Both involve the use of force and the repression of the right of their respective peoples freely to determine their own destiny. We cannot give our willing assent to flagrant violations of the Charter or ignore the danger to world peace inherent in these intolerable acts of aggression. My delegation appeals to everyone present in this Assembly to unite and, with one voice, to urge the parties concerned to return to the peaceful and orderly processes of settlement of the problems of Afghanistan and Kampuchea.


Turning to another subject, my delegation views with deep regret the failure of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea to adopt the convention on the law of the sea. Last year, it will be recalled, the Assembly acknowledged the nearly-completed draft not only as being important in itself, but as being an example of how much the United Nations can achieve when the requisite will is present. Our expectations, unfortunately, proved, to be premature but not, we hope, irremediable.


We express the view of a majority in this forum that to reopen fundamental issues already decided by 'consensus over the span of a decade of arduous labour would amount to rejection of the draft convention.


The importance of that convention cannot be overestimated. It is vital to peace and stability in the oceans. A clear determination of the extent of the sovereignty and jurisidiction of States over the waters of the seas is needed to avoid economic and political conflicts, and even military confrontations, caused by uncertainty. The orderly exploitation under an international regime of these rich nodules on the ocean floor is necessary to implement the principle that the resources of the seas outside national jurisdictions are the common heritage of mankind.


The failure of the Conference to conclude a universally accepted convention would be tragic, because the alternative is chaos in the regime of the seas. For the sake of humanity, all States must resolve to reach final agreement at the next session of the Conference. My delegation suggests that the Conference, scheduled for March and April 1982, should have enough leeway so that it can extend its eight-week session by one or two weeks if necessary to complete its work.


On another important question, the Philippines reafffirms its firm commitment to the successful outcome of the work of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization. The Charter, like every product of the human mind, is not immune from reform. It is not perfect. It must be dynamic and must adapt to the altered circumstances of a world in transition.


The Special Committee on the Charter has negotiated at length on the draft Manila declaration on the peaceful settlement of international disputes, the first tangible product of the Committee following many years of activity. We are hopeful that the draft will be completed and adopted at an early date, and that this will lead to further steps, including a treaty on the peaceful settlement of disputes, with binding obligations.


The task which confronts us at this session of the General Assembly is a formidable one. In nearly every corner of the world, potentials for danger exist, threatening to cancel out the patient work of the Organization on behalf of peace. This is a time of testing for the United Nations that will last for many years to come. In the face of grave crises we need to summon all the resources of courage and wisdom at our command, always keeping in view the great goal of achieving a better life for all in an enVironment of peace and justice.


We shall be guided, Mr. President, by your wise counsel, and we shall be fortified by the boundless patience and unsurpassed statesmanship of the Secretary General, who embodies in his own person the very qualities which have made the United Nations an indispensable tool for the solution of the grave problems which face us in times of crisis."	1981-09-23
Carlos P. Romulo	UNGA 37	"My delegation extends its warm congratulations to Mr. Hollai on his unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. It is my pleasure to have known him for several years as a friend. His wide experience, especially in the affairs of the United Nations, and his richly deserved reputation for skill, patience and the accumulated wisdom of experience constitute a guarantee that this session will be fruitful and constructive. We look to his guidance and leadership in the resolution of the numerous problems that exist at in this most critical period for the relations among nations.


To his predecessor, Mr. Kittani, who served under similarly difficult circumstances and emerged with honour, my delegation also extends its congratulations.


We are delighted to welcome the new Secretary General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. A thorough professional, he is universally regarded as a diplomat's diplomat, and we are happy that he is now at the head of the Organization. He has revealed to us the other side of his nature courage and candour in admitting the deficiencies of the United Nations, together with constructive suggestions which should enable us to return to the first principles of the Charter. The Secretary-General has seen us as in a mirror and asked us to take a closer look at ourselves with a view to providing remedies for the ailments of the United Nations system. In expressing his views the Secretary General has reminded us that the strengthening of the United Nations is the first order of business and that the performance of this task, difficult though it may be, is indispensable to the solution of the problems which threaten the peace of the world.


In the past we have often tended to substitute hyperbole for thought. Today the situation has changed: hyperbole has turned into fact. The. tragic events in Lebanon, serious problems in themselves, reverberate throughout the entire Middle East and raise anew the unwelcome prospects of wider conflict. The Middle East is the vortex of crisis and, if the past is a guide to the future, it will almost certainly involve other Powers in a conflict which may well be larger and more destructive than any in the unending series of Middle East wars.


At the core of the problem is the issue of Palestine. The new and highly disturbing element is a widely perceived effort to solve the problem not through political means, but by the use of force. This is clearly unacceptable, not only in terms of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) but also in terms of the principles of the Charter.


No one is under any illusion that the Middle East situation can be solved on the instant, but it is quite correct to say that the end of armed conflict offers fresh opportunities for a new start. The intractable problem is ingrained psychological blocks which make dialogue more difficult than it should be. This is why negotiations must be a process that is, a continuing dialogue which makes compromises possible. For this reason, my delegation welcomes the initiatives of President Reagan and the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez. We believe that these are starting points which in the course of the negotiating process could be merged, in the legitimate interests of all the parties concerned.


My delegation identifies with the positive elements of the United States proposal, which is based on the Camp David accords ratified by the Israeli Knesset, notably the immediate freeze on the establishment of Jewish settlements and opposition to permanent control by brael over the West Bank and Gaza.


My delegation maintains, however, that the full autonomy envisaged fo, these areas should lead to the implementation of the right of self-determination by the Palestinian people and the establishment of an independent State coexisting with Israel. We hold, furthermore, that at an appropriate stage in the process the PLO should be a party to the negotiations leading to permanent peace in the area.


It should be noted that neither the United States nor the Arab States have rejected each other's proposals. This fact leads to the hope, however tenuous, that each recognizes certain common denominators in the proposals and to the further recognition that in the existing circumstances, modality is of the utmost importance.


It is Israel that has proved to be intransigent, possibly in the euphoria of military success. But the one thing it must acknowledge is that its military victory over the PLO has, by a curious paradox, improved the political standing of the PLO. Because of the events in Lebanon, Israel may find itself with its back against the wall, with foes but no friends and isolated beyond hope of redemption. We very much doubt that this is what Israel wants. We therefore call upon Israel to heed the voices of reason and moderation. Too much blood has been spilled in the Middle East and too many bitter tears shed for Israel to ignoie the growing clamour for peace with justice and honour.


To Kampuchea, on the other side of the world, the hopeful sign is the formation of the Coalition of Kam?uchean Nationalists under the leadership of Prince Samdech Norodom Sihanouk. The formation of the Coalition signifies the determination of the Kamr,uchean nationalists to expel the foreign forces from Kampuchean soil and enable its people to exercise freely their right to self-determination.


In deciding on a coalition the Kampuchean nationalists have assumed the mantle of legality, a cloak denied them before although they fought and continue to fight, with valour, and in circumstances of insuperable difficulties.


If they are to succeed in their endeavour, they will require material assistance from friends that have in this very Hall condemned the illegitimate usurpation of Kampuchea by Viet Nam. At this very moment thousands of Kampucheans await the call in the determined effort to recover their birthright. We have every hope that, with the support of friends, the Kampuchean coalition or the democratic Government of Kampuchea will in the end pave the way for the restoration of Kampuchean sovereignty in free elections under the supervision of the United Nations. In the face of this development, Viet Nam has a final uption: to wipe out the fledgling and under-supplied anti-Vietnamese forces before their movement gathers strength and momentum. There are reports that this is precisely what it intends to do. It is in this light that the need for support and assistance acquires urgency. We urge our friends to provide it.


Another potential source of tension in Asia is the uncertain and precarious relations between North and South Korea. Conflict in that divided country is bound to have a severe impact in the strategic region of North-East Asia. Therefore we would encourage the parties concerned to launch fresh initiatives which could lead towards the goal of reunification. President Chun of South Korea has taken the initiative in this regard and he deserves our support.


I shall refrain from dealing with subjects already touched upon by President Marcos when he addressed th~ Assembly the other day [3rd meeting]. I might only add that, with respect to the launching of global negotiations on international economic co-operation for development, we might remind ourselves once more that these negotiations were conceived in light of our shared concern over the steady deterioration of our economies. The need to establish a firm basis for global economic progress that is equitable to all acquires added importance in view of the inadequate response of some of our institutions to the problems of contemporary economic refations. In joint efforts and in an admirable spirit of compromise encouraged by the high-level meetings in Cancun, Ottawa, Versailles and New Delhi, among others, we have managed to reach agreements on nearly all the outstanding points of difference.


I recall that, at the signing of the Bretton Woods Agreement in New Hampshire in 1946, when I signed the Agreement on behalf of the Philippines, I then said: ""The economic pattern being drawn here was established by the victorious Allies, but this will not last long. More members of the United Nations will join in the future. Last year we signed a United Nations Charter with 54 nations. I envision more than 100 nations will join. In that case they will decide that they want a new international economic order."" I said that in 1946, when we signed the Bretton Woods Agreement. That is now the North-South dialague.


As we resume discussions at this session, we diverge on only two points. To those who hold differing views on these two points, these are no doubt of great importance, and their reluctance to accept either is therefore understandable. Yet the potential reward of agreement and the possible penalties of failure to reach agreement are of such magnitude that they allow us few, if any, options. Therefore I wou!d urge all parties to look beyond narrower preoccupations for the sake of the larger good. On the part of the Philippines, my delegation is prepared to accept neither one nor the other formulation but both formulations in a common text. We do so in the firm belief that in practice and application the two points are not necessarily irreconcilable. Such an approach, in our view, would close the last remaining gap and thus enable the long-delayed global negotiations to get under way.


Turning to another subject of a global character, my delegation wishes to express its gratification at the completion of the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. It has involved many years of difficult negotiations but it is certainly one of the more hopeful signs of the rich possibilities open in the way of international cooperation.


Although the Convention on the Law of the Sea was not adopted by consensus, as originally planned, this does not detract from the importance of the work of the Conference. The monumental document produced by the Conference will, when it enters into force, become the international law, or the law of mankind, which will govern the rights and duties of nations on the uses of the waters of the earth. We in ASEAN are proud that the President who steered the Conference on the Law of the Sea to that final declaration is Mr. Koh, the representative of Singapore, one of the nations of ASEAN. It is the earnest hope of my delegation, as well as of the 130 nations which voted for the Convention, that in the interests of an orderly regime on the seas of the world those that did not find it possible to vote for it will in the future accede to it and thus make the Convention universal in fact as well as in law.


Allow me to return to the subject of the Secretary- General's report. It is a subject of extreme importance and should, if we are aware of our responsibilities, provoke a great deal of thought among us.


For years my delegation, having in mind Article 109 of the Charter, which suggests the holding of a general conference for a review of the Charter, has proposed that steps be taken towards amending it. Unfortunately, the assumptions, not to speak of the circumstances, which inspired the founding fathers in framing the Charter of the United Nations changed almost immediately after its ratification. To press the issue of a general conference at this time would raise a political storm which we can ill afford in a time of persisting crises.


In recognition of the post-atomic realities, the Assembly did approve the creation of a Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization in a search for ways and means of improving the functioning of the United Nations within the framework of the present Charter. The Special Committee is now ready to present to the Assembly the first concrete document resulting from a labour of nearly seven years. The draft Manila declaration is a worthy attempt to provide specific interpretations of the Charter's provisions on the peaceful settlement of disputes and in this sense it constitutes a watershed in the efforts of the Organization to ensure the wellbeing of peoples and the maintenance of international peace and security and in addition promote the progressive development of international law. If I read properly between the lines of the Secretary-General's report, that is precisely what he means.


It has been said that there are two United Nations. The first United Nations has on balance achieved remarkable progress in the economic and social fields, notably in assisting the younger nations in their first faltering efforts at development.


But the same cannot be said of the second, the other United Nations in its primary role of maintaining international peace and security. This is the theme which the Secretary-General develops in his bold and perceptive annual report. Thank God for a Secretary-General who sees through the difficulties that we face. His suggestions cannot be dismissed lightly for, as head of the Organization, his voice carries special weight and authority.


My delegation is prepared to support the Secretary- General's suggestion for a meeting of the Security Council ""at the highest possible level"" to discuss the problems which have impaired the proper functioning of the Organization as envisioned by its founders. I can do no better in closing than to quote the words of the Secretary-General which we should always bear in mind in this Hall: "" ... I am absolutely convinced that the United Nations is indispensable in a world fraught with tension and peril. Institutions such as this are not built in a day. They require constant constructive work and fidelity to the principles on which they are based. .. We take the United Nations seriously when we desperately need it. I would urge that we also seriously consider the practical ways in which it should develop its capacity and be used as an essential institution in a stormy and uncertain world."" [A/37/ I, p. 4.]


As one who has been deeply involved in the United Nations from the very start and bitterly regretted its defeats and savoured its triumphs, I compliment the Secretary-General on his acute analysis of the United Nations. I share with him the view that we should work unremittingly to build a sense of world community on the firm foundation of a political and moral order which alone can lift mankind to the ''broad sunlit uplands"" of peace and security."	1982-09-27
Carlos P. Romulo	UNGA 38	"It is a privilege to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. You bring to this high office impeccable qualifications, experience and wisdom. It is a tribute to Panama that one of its illustrious sons, a former Minister for Foreign Affairs and currently the Vice-President of its Government, now serves as President of the Assembly. Panama and the Philippines share a common historical heritage and strong ties of friendship. It is therefore with greater pleasure that we see you lead our deliberations. At the same time, we extend our congratulations to the outgoing President. Working under the pressure of serious international events, he discharged his duty with admirable dispatch and objectivity.


We begin our deliberations under the shadow of a horrible disaster. The loss of the commercial airliner, KAL Flight 007, shot down under circumstances not satisfactorily explained, is a tragedy in human terms. What is undeniable is that the unarmed commercial plane was destroyed by missiles fired by Soviet military aircraft and that all its 269 innocent--I repeat, innocent--passengers, of whom 24 were Filipinos, perished. My Government and people share the universal condemnation of and indignation over the loss of human lives, and we have formally asked for a full investigation to establish responsibility for the disaster. We have also asked for reparations to the families of the deceased.


The tragedy has another dimension. It could aggravate tensions between the super-Powers. It is therefore a matter of serious concern to the Assembly. To prevent its repetition we suggest that the Assembly begin the study of new and binding international agreements to ensure the safety of commercial aviation in circumstances similar to those which befell the Korean airliner.


This year has seen a sharp increase in the intensity and proliferation of conflict in the world. More than ever, the world Organization, through no intrinsic fault of its own, has been relegated to the sidelines in the very circumstances that it was created to moderate and resolve. This is not in keeping with the intent of the founders or in accordance with the will of the majority of the Members. It is brought about rather, by the reluctance of a few States to acknowledge the will of the global community. It is, of course, these very conditions which led to the demise of the League of Nations.


We are only too aware of the highly volatile situation in the region of the world where my country is located, where foreign troops continue to occupy Kampuchea. The international community has repeatedly called for a comprehensive political solution to the Kampuchean problem which will provide for the withdrawal of all foreign forces and ensure respect for the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and neutral and non-aligned status of Kampuchea, as well as the right of the Kampuchean people to self-determination free from outside interference. My Government, in concert with other members of ASEAN, is firmly committed to the restoration of a stable and lasting peace in the region based on the real independence of the Kampuchean people. The countries members of ASEAN have therefore issued an appeal for Kampuchean independence which has been circulated to the members of the General Assembly [A/38/441). My country places considerable hope in the future of the coalition headed by Samdech Norodom Sihanouk as President. The international community has recognized this coalition as the legitimate representative Government of this sad and decimated country. A chain of events that will be positive for the peace, freedom and neutrality of South-East Asia can follow the restoration of Kampuchea to the Kampuchean people. We believe that the international community must renew and redouble its efforts to achieve that result.


In Afghanistan, the international community is similarly called upon to undertake fresh efforts to restore the legitimate right of the people of Afghanistan freely to determine their own destiny. The intensified activities of the foreign troops there suggest that they are in Afghanistan to stay. The Assembly cannot, on the basis of the principles which are its reason for being, accept this intolerable situation. The failure to make headway on the Afghanistan problem is all the more regrettable in view of the exemplary efforts of the special representative of the Secretary-General, our able Mr. Diego Cordovez, to promote a meeting of minds at the Geneva conference. In the middle of this year, progress was achieved only to founder on the rock of technicalities which have their real basis in lack of confidence and political will. In another part of the world, the visit of the Secretary- General to Namibia and South Africa last month, under a mandate from the Security Council, def med the basic problems which impede agreement on the steps which could lead to the independence of Namibia. The question is whether South Africa genuinely wants a solution. In its view, Namibia is not the problem; the problem is Angola. Yet it is clear that the security problems of both South Africa and Angola are not necessarily resistant to solution. In the view of my Government, further progress on the question of Namibia can be achieved only when South Africa recognizes its larger responsibility for the peace of the whole of southern Africa, of which it is an integral part.


If there is an area of the world pre-eminently on the minds of all members of the world community, it is the Middle East, including the situation in Lebanon. We can recall many years, even decades, of relative harmony and peace in a prosperous Lebanon. One of the root causes of the turmoil which has destroyed the political balance in what had been a peaceful country is the unresolved problem of the future of the Palestinian people. Lebanon's invasion by Israel has now led to the direct involvement of major Powers in the area. The most immediate need, in our view, is for a cease-fire and the cessation of hostilities throughout Lebanon. We rejoice that such a cease-fire has been achieved and we join in the hope of the Secretary of State, Mr. Shultz, that the fact will force Syria and Israel to follow suit. The efforts of the United Nations to deploy, at a minimum, observer teams should continue to be supported, and the goal remains the withdrawal of all unauthorized non-Lebanese forces. At aa appropriate time it would also be highly desirable to replace the remaining non-Lebanese forces with a United Nations peace-keeping presence, while the Government of Leba.""lon consolidates its role and the democratic political balance is restored. We were happy to read the statement of the Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia today, when he said that an agreement had been reached for a cease-fire in Lebanon, ending the war and starting a national dialogue. What has been secured is a great achievement. We appeal to all our Lebanese brothers to go beyond the bloodshed and the hatred to resume the building of Lebanon.


The Middle East, however, will not cease to be a seed-bed of conflict until the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination-including its right to establish an independent State in Palestine-and the rights of all States in the region, including Israel, to a secure existence within internationally recognized borders are assured.


If the Middle East remains a dangerous flash-point for global conflict and possibly for nuclear war, the accumulation of weapons designed for such a war also continues to accelerate.


Is there anything new to be said about the arms race? Each year we rehearse the frightful statistics, the wasteful sums spent on the arms race, both conventional and nuclear, which could have been better used for economic development.


The United States has something like 9,500 warheads in its strategic arsenal, while the USSR disposes of 7,700. Two or three hundred are generally regarded as sufficient to devastate either nation. The USSR has about 13,000 smaller nuclear explosives, each much larger than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in the Second World War, while the United States has a tactical arsenal of about 20,000 smaller weapons.


The number of resolutions on disarmament adopted last year is a measure both of the concern felt in the international community and of the futility of the effort we have made year after year to elucidate positive action from the two major protagonists. In the past 20 years the major Powers have not cared to complete a comprehensive test ban, a modest first step in slowing down the nuclear arms race. It is both unconscionable and untliinkable that not even this small step has been achieved.


The most needed step now is an immediate moratorium on the development and production of new strategic nuclear weapons systems.


I take some hope from the newer directions which are beginning to emerge in the Disarmament Commission and other bodies of the Organization. The concept of common security developed in the report of the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues' parallels a concern which I have long expressed. I am convinced that a search for security is bound by its very emphasis to be more fruitful than a search for disarmament per se. As Chairman of the Group of Experts on the Relationship between Disarmament and International Security, I have pointed out that States have chosen to emphasize the pursuit of arms limitation and disarmament without examining how security is to be provided in the absence of national arms and armies.


The Secretary-General, in his report of a year ago, strongly stressed the ways in which the United Nations and its Members were failing to live up to their responsibilities, especially in the field of the maintenance of international peace and security. We fully shared his view then, as we do now. The world Organization is principally afflicted by the indifference of some of its significant Members.


With the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations a major effort was begun to enhance the capabilities of the United Nations in the light of the manifold changes which had taken place in the world since its founding. The major focus for this effort has solidified in the 47-nation Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization. During the course of its existence the Special Committee has produced the most substantial study on ways to improve the United Nations that has so far been developed. Most of the members of the Committee have contributed their best efforts to this end.


At its previous session, the General Assembly adopted the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes [see resolution 37110), a major achievement of the Special Committee. Based on the urgency lent to the work of the Special Committee by the report of the Secretary-General, we were optimistic that further significant results would be forthcoming from that Committee. Unfortunately such has not been the case. The session of the Committee during this year has been a disappointing and disheartening one, despite the best efforts of its able Chairman, Mr. Nabil El-Araby, of Egypt. We are gratified, of course, that discussion on a joint proposal by Romania and the Philippines on the establishment of a permanent United Nations commission for mediation, conciliation and good offices has begun, and we look forward to further elaboration of this proposal.


The world economy is in disarray. Despite signs of limited progress, large portions of the earth are in the deadly grip of poverty. Yet we accept the principle that interdependence is not an option but a fact. It involves mutuality of interests and commonly derived solutions. Where these new realities are resisted, a malfunction in the infrastructure of the world economy inevitably develops. Withheld participation leads to imbalance and inequities.


The thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly was extended until 19 September in a desperate effort to launch global negotiations on international economic co-operation. That it failed is symptomatic of the malaise characterizing this aspect of international relations.


The results of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development are a further sign of such malaise. That meeting, begun with bright promise when the developing countries, in their meetings at New Delhi and Buenos Aires, decided to  approach the session of the Conference held at Belgrade with an expressed willingness to co-operate. The lack of significant results has left us with a bitter aftertaste.


We have no magic recipes for ending the impasse, but my Government will continue to contribute its modest share to every effort to overcome those problems. It was in this spirit that we proposed last year the inclusion in the agenda of an item entitled ""New international human order: moral aspects of development'' . We believe that the establishment of a moral framework for economic cooperation provides an important key to the promotion of the inevitable just international economic co-operation. I hope that together we can elaborate a new international human order for economic co-operation.


We look with favour on the joint proposal submitted by the delegations of Malaysia and Antigua and Barbuda on consideration of the question of Antarctica [A/38/193]. A study of this subject should enhance understanding of that Ia6ely unknown continent. We believe that the destiny of Antarctica is a matter of universal concern and should not be left in the hands of a few States only.


As I leave this rostrum, I wish to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, who has brought to his office a refreshing candour, as well as the courage of his convictions. He has provided us with lucid insights into the problems besetting the world. At the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly, he asked Member States to redouble their efforts to solve their differences, and at the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, at New Delhi in March, he reminded us that the United Nations should be developed more as a forum for negotiations and agreements and less as a place of confrontation and debate. In his report to the current session [A/38/1], he outlines the various issues confronting the Assembly and calls for a recommitment to the Charter because, ""With an objective as elusive and as vital as the preservation of peace, a sense of shared purpose and direction is imperative.""


In conclusion, I should like to quote from a speech delivered by General Omar Bradley in 1957. General Bradley was of course an American and his words were addressed to his fellow Americans, but they retain, a generation later. perfect relevance to the problems of our time and address all citizens of the world. He said: ""The central problem of our time . . . is how to employ human intelligence for the salvation of mankind. It is a problem we have put upon ourselves. ""If I am sometimes discouraged, it is not by the magnitude of the problem but by our colossal indifference to it. I am unable to understand why . . . we do not make greater, more diligent and more imaginative use of reason and human intelligence in seeking an accord and compromise which will make it possible for mankind to control the atom and banish it as an instrument of war. ""Unless we soon get started [on a just accord], it may be too late . . . Time is running against us, and it is running against us with the speed of Sputnik."" I leave you with this food for thought."	1983-09-26
Salvador C. Tolentino	UNGA 39	"Allow me to congratulate the President on his election to chair the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. His reputation as a skilled diplomat and a statesman of wise judgement assures us of the sober yet dynamic leadership that we need in the Assembly to accomplish our tasks.


We should all be sadly remiss if we failed to commend the Secretary-General on his endeavours in the cause of peace and on his report on the work of the Organization [A/39/1]. The Secretary-General is both a staunch defender and a stern critic of the United Nations. In performing that important and necessary task he has put all of us in his debt.


The Philippines warmly welcomes Brunei Darussalam as the 159th Member of the United Nations. The historic ties between Brunei and the Philippines are centuries old, and these have found modern reaffirmation in their active partnership in the Association of South-East Asian Nations \[ASEAN], where they share common goals, aspirations and perceptions of regional peace, security and stability with the other members of ASEAN.


I speak today at the same rostrum where my illustrious predecessor, Mr. Carlos P. Romulo, on many occasions delivered, with great eloquence and uncommon wit, the Philippine policy statements. Mr. Romulo has sought retirement after a long public life in distinguished service to his country and people and to humanity, as a passionate advocate of the United Nations, sharing deeply its resolve to ""save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"". We all miss Mr. Romulo at these sessions of the Assembly, but we find comfort in the thought that we can still avail ourselves of the gems of wisdom that he has left in the annals of this international body.


Of the numerous photographs taken by the astronauts from outer space, there is one that is firmly impressed on our minds. It is the picture of the earth, taken from hundreds of thousands of miles away, showing a globe of ethereal quality and breathtaking beauty, suspended in space, calm, serene and peaceful. But as we look around us we are confronted by the chilling realization that we live in a world riven by suspicion and distrust, a world obsessed by the frenzied competition to accumulate weapons of mass destruction, a world where peace is constantly challenged by the overwhelming drive to dominate, to impose one's superior will on weaker parties, and to use both guile and armed strength to achieve such ends.


Indeed, the peace of the world today hangs in a fragile balance; the world is on the brink of a self-imposed holocaust of dimensions so vast it could erase human civilization from the face of the earth.


Let me turn to a most vital issue of our time. The subject of nuclear arms and their control has for too long been cluttered with the doctrines, concepts and esoteric jargon of the war-room strategist and nuclear-arms specialist. It is time for us to sweep all these aside and get down to the elementary facts which all of us can understand.


First, nuclear weapons do not confer absolute security, and accumulating more and more of them diminishes security. Secondly, there can be no limited nuclear war. Once nuclear weapons are used, their use will escalate into a full nuclear exchange that could spell the death of all of us. The profound global climatic changes following the onset of the nuclear night, as both Soviet and American scientists have recently described it, will not spare even those of us outside the immediate areas of nuclear blast and radiation. Thirdly, human civilization as we know it will be effectively exterminated.


Our generation has coined a word to describe the deliberate destruction of a group of people""genocide"". What word shall we use to describe the extermination of the entire human race? Shall we call it ""humanicide""? Will the nuclear super-Powers in the end be responsible for this absolute, this final crime against humanity? Shall they be the ultimate perpetrators of ""humanicide""?


The nuclear Powers have among them more than enough of the instruments of nuclear death to extinguish the human race. By the same token, they have in their hands the power and the means to ensure the survival of human civilization on earth. The options are clear to all of us.


Surely, it should not be impossible for the nuclear Powers to see that, for man to survive, there can be only one possible course: we must utilize to the fullest extent the available means of negotiation and diplomacy to end the nuclear-arms race and to reduce and eventually eliminate nuclear weapons.


In the light of recent statements of the leaders of the super-Powers, we are encouraged by the possibility of new initiatives emanating from them that could lead to resumption of negotiations.


All over the world the flash-points of danger of last year and prior years continue to fuel global unrest and instability. Foreign troops continue to occupy Kampuchea, imposing on its people the terrors of war and economic deprivation and sending thousands of them desperately to seek refuge in other lands. My delegation hopes that the repeated calls of the international community for the total withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from Kampuchea and a comprehensive political settlement of the Kampuchean problem will finally be heeded by the parties concerned. The Philippines will continue to work for the ultimate triumph of the principle of self-determination in Kampuchea.


Thousands of people have died and are dying violently each year in Afghanistanpeople trapped in a savage war between foreign military occupiers and the Afghan fighters who seek to restore their national independence and sovereignty. The Philippines will continue to support the efforts of the Secretary-General to achieve a peaceful political solution to the problem of Afghanistan.


We should guard against the illusion that stability has been achieved in the Middle East. Until the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination is accepted, the Middle East will remain a tinder-box posing serious threats not just to regional peace but also to the peace of the entire international community. We therefore urge renewed discussions on the modalities for the establishment of a Palestinian State.


Success continues to elude the efforts of several States to bring to an end the dangerous conflict between Iran and Iraq. My delegation will fully support conciliatory efforts to bring peace and stability to the Gulf, a region of sensitive importance to many States where protracted war between two countries heightens the risk of escalated violence and enlargement of the area of conflict.


The inherent evil of apartheid continues to fuel violence in South Africa and instability in that part of the African continent. South Africa's new Constitution, which purports to liberalize its policy of racial separation, merely deepens the chasm between the black majority and the white minority. Until the vast majority of the disenfranchised population is made a full part of the political process, apartheid will remain.


The people of Namibia, long deprived of their independence, continue to pursue their struggle for national liberation. My delegation hopes to see the implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia, so that the Namibian people can finally begin the task of building a nation and a viable economy which can contribute to peace and progress in southern Africa.


The internecine conflicts in Central America have destabilized a once peaceful and prosperous region of the world, exacting a grim toll, through armed violence, in lives lost and properties destroyed. My delegation, sensitive to our close historic and cultural ties to the countries of Central America, fully supports the initiatives of the Contadora Group for the restoration of peace and stability in that region.


Tensions persist in the Korean peninsula. My delegation takes a positive posture on the initiatives undertaken by both sides that could lead to a peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula. The interests of world peace and security would be served if North and South Korea could return to the negotiating table. In keeping with the principle of universality, they could, if they so desired, become Members of the United Nations without prejudice to reunification.


A cause of future conflict lies at the bottom of the sea. In the past, wars have been fought over mineral deposits on land. The fabulous abundance of polymetallic nodules in the deep sea-bedthe future source of manganese, cobalt, copper and nickelcould trigger dangerous conflicts and confrontations, unless the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the regime set out in the Convention for the exploration and exploitation of the resources of the deep sea-bed in the international area are implemented and respected by all.


We note with concern, therefore, the Provisional Understanding regarding Deep Sea-Bed Matters concluded at Geneva on 3 August 1984 by eight industrialized countries \[see A/39/647, para. 84]. In our view, the agreement is contrary to the letter and the spirit of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.


The Philippines has ratified that Convention and my delegation earnestly urges others to do the same so that it may come into force very soon.


The dismal picture of the world today is becoming even gloomier and more tragic because of the increasing economic inequalities among nations and peoples. The consequence is the uncontained deterioration of conditions in the poorer countries of the world. There can be no real peace without economic security.


Peace, as understood by small and poor countries and their peoples, means the satisfaction of the basic needs of man; it means the preservation and sustenance of human life and the improvement of its quality. Since the United Nations is a vital instrument for peace, it must have the development of humanity at the very heart of its activities.


It is in the interest of all countriesdeveloped and developingthat global economic recovery should be sustained in a manner which would effectively halt the massive debilitating effects of recession on international growth and stability. The early signs of economic recovery, however, have not made the desired impact on the development efforts of small and poor countries. On the contrary, for many of them their efforts at development have been even more difficult, if not altogether frustrated.


For economic recovery to foster global peace and security, continuous efforts should be undertaken towards a comprehensive and equitable solution of the development problems of many countries. To attain this objective, the position of the developing countries in such areas as international trade, global industrialization, money and finance, food and agriculture, and energy should be taken fully into account.


The requirements of the developing countries in international trade would include, among others, first, the liberalization of trade and the reduction if not elimination of non-tariff barriers, such as quotas, seasonal restrictions, licensing requirements, variable levies and anti-dumping regulations; and, secondly, the elimination of the so-called voluntary export restraint schemes which are undertaken on a bilateral and discriminatory basis outside the principles and rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.


Developing countries need to augment their industrial output and to increase their share in total world industrial production to support the self-reliant growth of their economies. But in order for them to be able to do so, they should be provided with all the needed assistance, including the transfer of technology. In the final analysis, the meaning of industrialization is to contribute to the eradication of endemic poverty in the developing world.


In many developing countries the problems of hunger and malnutrition cannot be adequately addressed because of their balance-of-payments difficulties and mounting external debts. This suggests that current international efforts to relieve food scarcity in many areas of the world should be expanded. The impediments to food sufficiency and its availability on a wider basis, including the problems of production and distribution, should receive intensive scrutiny.


The international monetary and financial system should be made increasingly responsive to the needs and interests of developing countries. The reform of the system should be supportive of a balanced and equitable development of the world economy and accelerated development of developing countries. It should also encourage the flow of official development assistance and increase regional development finance in response to the growing needs of developing countries. Furthermore, the reforms should focus on the resolution of the external debt problems of developing countries, now estimated to be in excess of $550 billion.


Food and energy are interrelated. Every increase in the price of energy has adverse repercussions on the costs of production and distribution of food. The need to industrialize and to produce adequate food supplies will require an increase in energy supplies. If, however, the costs of access to energy supplies are prohibitive, the developing countries would be even more seriously handicapped in their development programmes and projects.


After 39 years of the United Nations, the picture of the world today seems indeed bleak and discouraging. The prevalence of pockets of war in many corners of the world, of unprovoked acts of aggression by more powerful nations against weaker nations, of unabated racial discrimination, of the growing economic imbalance between the rich and the poor countries of the world with the resulting social inequalities and of the spreading hunger and misery among large sections of the earths populationall that and more are the hard realities we must face.


Many independent observers feel that, tested in the light of its aims and the principles embodied in its Charter, the United Nations has failed, and that it seems unable to accomplish the objectives for which it was founded. This may not be entirely correct or true, but it should make us take a hard second look at the Charter itself, because the perceived inadequacies of the world Organization may actually spring from factors inherent in its own constitution.


We must not allow initiatives to review the Charter to languish from lack of support. We should devote our most vigorous and sustained efforts to make the Organization a more effective instrument for the attainment of its avowed objectives.


The United Nations, after all, is the only remaining hope of mankind for universal peace and security. It is mans last best hope to free himself from hunger and fear. In your own words, Mr. President, the world would become a more dangerous place without the United Nations \[1st meeting, para. 96]. Accordingly, our solemn duty is to preserve and strengthen the world Organization while the opportunity exists and while time may still be on our side. That is the challenge confronting us today."	1984-09-27
Pacifico A. Castro	UNGA 40	"I wish to convey to you, Sir, the felicitations and best wishes of 54 million Filipinos on your unanimous election as President of this historic fortieth session of the United Nations General Assembly. The Republic of the Philippines has had centuries of historical relations with the Kingdom of Spain. That is why we are confident that under your able and sagacious leadership the causes of the universal peace and development so vitally needed in our time will be further advanced this year. I also wish to commend your distinguished predecessor, Ambassador Paul Lusaka of Zambia, whom I had the pleasure of working with in Bandung, Indonesia, during the recent meeting to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the Asia-Africa Conference.


Since we began the general debate 17 days ago, 14 Heads of State or Government, 88 Foreign Ministers and 25 plenipotentiaries have stated from this rostrum their respective national positions on issues currently on our agenda. They have also articulated their visions of the future based on our common experience during the past 40 years as the United Nations moves inexorably forward to the next millennium.


Like my predecessors during the past four decades, I will at the outset deliver the recurring opening salvo, so to speak, of our yearly policy statements before this forum, which is a resounding call to all nations to heed the universal clamour for peace and the rule of law in international relations. If the Philippines persists in its efforts to pursue the course of peace it is because we have suffered successive invasions and domination by many foreign Powers. That is why as early as 1935 we solemnly enshrined in our Constitution a declaration renouncing war as an instrument of national policy, and adopted the generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of our land. In 1973 we expanded those noble objectives by proclaiming in a new Constitution our adherence to a policy of peace, equality, justice, freedom, co-operation and amity with all nations. Thus, it is inevitable that we share the frustrations of many of our brothers and sisters here present at the slow progress towards universal peace.


The peace that we seek is not merely the absence of bi-national or regional conflicts but internal peace brought about by a universal respect for the right of sovereign States to equality and non-interference in their domestic affairs.


Respect for Philippine democratic institutions was established freely by the sovereign electorate in free, fair, open and universal suffrage when we ratified our new Constitution, which created a republican parliamentary form of government, in 1973, when we voted for members of our parliament in 1978 and again in 1984 and when we re-elected President Ferdinand E. Marcos for a third term in 1981. The Filipino electorate will once again go to the polls in 1986 to elect their provincial governors as well as city and municipal mayors and council members and in 1987 to elect a President of the Republic. All we ask is scrupulous respect for United Nations resolutions and declarations on the inadmissibility of intervention in the domestic affairs of States so that our people will be able once again to exercise freely their right to self-determination. Also, and above all, we call for strict non-interference in the problem of insurgency that has confronted our people since 1946. We should like to assure the General Assembly that, as in the past, the Filipinos are capable of settling this problem by themselves. There is no danger whatsoever that the Philippines will become a flash-point of conflict, as has been the macabre wish of the Western media during the past two years.


While others have placed the entire responsibility for the awesome task of peace-keeping on the United Nations and condemned it for its apparent ineffectiveness, the Philippines would like to believe that the United Nations has done more than any past concert or collectivity of sovereign States. We have at least reined in the atavistic human forces eager to plunge the world anew into a cataclysm.


True, there have been and are still ongoing regional wars and conflicts, but through the instruments and mechanisms that we instituted in the United Nations Charter we have effectively arrested their degeneration into more catastrophic proportions. Who will deny the pacific roles played by peace-keeping forces in Kashmir, Korea, Congo, the Middle East, Cyprus and Lebanon? There is no doubt that the conflicts that we have seen since 1946 would have deteriorated beyond rational proportions had it not been for the timely interposition of a United Nations presence.


Indeed, as we commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the founding of our Organization, we should consecrate a day to the memory of those who have dedicated their lives to the service of international peace, such as the late Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjld, Count Folke Bernadotte and Ralph Bunche  the first and third of whom were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, to their lasting personal credit as well as that of the United Nations, which they served valiantly. The labours for peace are unending. Let us not forget either that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) have similarly been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their contributions to eradicating the scourge of war.


Therefore, I reiterate the almost universal call for the immediate and total withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea and full respect for the right of all Kampucheans to self-determination. Specifically, we call upon Viet Nam to demonstrate anew its commitment to peace and the rule of law by respecting United Nations resolutions on the peaceful settlement of the Kampuchean problem, particularly General Assembly resolutions 34/22, 35/6, 36/5, 37/6, 38/3 and 39/5.


We appeal to all peace-loving States to continue their valuable support for the unceasing and determined efforts of all the Members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  the Standing Committee of which the Philippines has the honour of presiding over this year  to restore peace, independence, freedom and justice to the suffering people of Kampuchea. For, as long as one nation is under military occupation, the ASEAN vision of making South-East Asia a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality will remain in the limbo of geopolitics.


Let us make 1986 a genuine international year of peace in South-East Asia by our renewed collective demand for the liberation of Kampuchea from all foreign military forces before the close of 1985.


Indeed, in our time precedents are not wanting for foreign military forces withdrawing unilaterally from parts of Indo-China. Within the context of the principle that Asian problems must be solved through Asian solutions by Asians themselves, we in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) are ready at any time to meet the Vietnamese and all concerned and interested parties, to discuss anything, to facilitate the speedy withdrawal of foreign military forces from Kampuchea. If we are to strengthen and give meaning to the United Nations as an instrument of peace, let us meet together now and pre-empt a bipolar solution to our regional problem  for it would be a serious blow to the sovereign rights of small States to have their fate decided by the big Powers.


Along the same lines, the Philippines supports all moves towards dtente, entente and co-operation in the Korean peninsula and hopes that this will eventually lead to the upgrading of the status of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea from that of Observers to full Members of the United Nations. This move will not only lend substance to the principle of universality but will also enrich the United Nations by the contributions of 62 million hard-working Koreans to the maintenance of international peace, security and development.


In Afghanistan, the continued presence of foreign occupation forces has likewise prevented the exercise of self-determination by the Afghan people and the restoration of their non-aligned status.


In the Middle East, the oil lifeline of most of the worlds energy deposits in the region remains in peril and could be cut off at any time on account of the continuing Iran-Iraq war. If this were to happen, the world would be plunged into a depression of unprecedented severity causing untold misery to mankind. We should like therefore to associate ourselves with all people of goodwill in the world who have called for a peaceful political settlement of this terrible war of attrition between two developing nations.


The Arab-Israeli conflict remains unresolved. Israel remains in possession of Jerusalem and the territories it occupied in the 1967 war. On the other hand, the right of Israel to exist behind secure boundaries remains unrecognized. In short, the issue continues to be stalemated and calls for imaginative settlement and initiative.


The Philippines has always sought to promote the pacific resolutions of international disputes. In 1982, the General Assembly adopted by consensus the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes. The Declaration embodies the sentiments of most States to solve their disputes through peaceful means. This goal must be accepted without any reservations and must be internalized by the international community with the active support of the United Nations. It is our hope that the protagonists in existing regional conflicts will retrieve this valuable document from their files and give it their thoughtful and serious consideration  for, who knows, it might yet hold the key to honourable solutions to otherwise intractable conflicts.


Besides these international disputes, the process of change within some countries has resulted in domestic instability which is promptly exported to adjoining regions.


In South Africa, the policy of apartheid by that country which is offensive to the sensibilities of mankind, has resulted in untold sufferings for the majority of its people. Moreover, it threatens the stability of the whole region. On the eve of the International Year of Peace, we call upon South Africa to restore, to respect and to protect the fundamental rights of Africans and all Coloured peoples in that tortured land. We also urge South Africa to heed the call of the international community for an independent and sovereign Namibia.


The process of modernization has always been attended by instability, as old institutions are torn down and replaced by new ones. But in Central America this process has been complicated by the intrusion of big-Power rivalry in the process of change. It is time that the countries in that region were left alone to seek out their own solutions and their own approaches for the modernization of their respective societies.


These political issues have been the continuing concern of the United Nations since its formative years. Over the years, international economic issues, which are just as destabilizing to world peace, have added a new dimension to global problems.


Two decades after the first United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD I), it is sad to note that the gap between the North and the South remains. Worse still, it is widening. In a nutshell, the primordial concern of the third-world countries remains the question of how to reduce the time frame of their development to meet the rising expectations of their peoples.


The pursuit of development requires massive infusion of investment funds. It cannot be denied that there is room for improvement on the measures which have been taken by some developing countries to increase domestic savings to finance their developmental needs. However, development projects require heavy foreign exchange components. In the final analysis, this requirement could only be met by making available adequate flows of foreign exchange to developing countries. This goal requires action on three fronts: trade, capital flows and official development assistance.


Exports of developing countries continue to be hampered by tariff and non-tariff barriers in the developed countries. What is more, the developing countries are getting trampled upon like the grass because of the proverbial quarrel between elephants.


Nowhere is this more evident than in the current trade wars among the industrial countries and the resulting surge of protectionism in some of these countries. While these protectionist measures by some developed countries are directed primarily against each others trade, their impact on the developing countries will nevertheless be more devastating because of their fragile economies. The escalating war of protectionism among the industrial countries has literally crushed all efforts at economic modernization by the developing countries no matter how heroic they may have been. To us in the third world, this is more awesome than the threat of the so-called Star Wars because it has already brought about the impoverishment of our peoples.



It gives us some hope that in the last Bonn summit the leaders of the industrial countries, realizing the dangers inherent in a protracted trade war, called for a new round of trade negotiations where the problems of the third world will also be addressed.


My Government wholeheartedly supports such a proposal even as we express the hope that the industrial countries will redouble their efforts in implementing the results of past commitments under the multilateral trade negotiations.


The decrease in petro-dollars has stifled the flow of capital to developing countries. Moreover, the continuing budget deficits in some of the major industrial countries necessitate massive borrowings in the world capital markets by these countries. The developing States are thus often faced with the unenviable task of competing with these affluent countries for scarce loanable funds in the world capital markets at interest rates and conditions that serve to aggravate their already disadvantaged positions. Indeed, the increasing debt burden of developing countries has become more onerous by inordinate interest rates and conditions. The United Nations cannot long ignore this problem for it could precipitate a global financial crisis unseen in the history of mankind. International action is necessary to avert this looming catastrophe.


The flow of resources to developing countries has remained way below the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product arrived at by international consensus. On average, the donor countries have allocated only 0.4 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance. As of 1984, only four donor countries have met or exceeded the 0.7 per cent target.


The shortfall of funds needed by the developing countries to meet their national development goals is a continuing crisis, and unless some drastic measures are taken the goal envisaged in the United Nations Charter of a peaceful and prosperous world will remain unfulfilled. New and bold initiatives are needed for resolving the issue. In this respect, it is high time the developed countries put a global perspective on some of their domestic programmes to reduce the inequities in their respective societies, such as those which encourage investments in depressed areas. Typically, such programmes consist of a package of incentives for relocating industries in those areas. These incentives could take such forms as lower income tax rates, low interest loans, free training assistance and the like.


If the developed countries were to view the third world in the same manner as the depressed areas in their respective societies, investments made in the developing countries would then be entitled to the same incentives and investments as those made in those depressed regions. As an initial and minimal step, the developed countries could apply a lower tax rate to income derived from new investments in developing countries. This proposal would undoubtedly improve the flow of investments into the third world. The philosophy behind the preferential treatment given to investments in those depressed areas is based on the sound reasoning that ultimately such regions, once developed, would cease to be a burden and become contributors to the national well-being. There is no doubt that most of the developing third-world countries could contribute just as positively to international prosperity, benefiting everyone, if they were given equal incentives to develop.


Since the major obstacle to the development of most of the third world is lack of sufficient resources, we view with encouragement the coming talks between the two super-Powers on arms control. My Government hopes that these talks will result in substantive cuts in defence spending. These savings could then be used for development spending. It has been estimated that $900 billion a year is spent on armaments by the whole world. Just a portion of this amount would go far towards accelerating the economic growth of the third world. Moreover, the world would experience a heightened sense of security through the mutual reduction of armaments.


The striving for development is, unfortunately, based on material things. In fact, most of the parameters used as indicators of progress are based on material goods. However, as the developed countries have already experienced, development has its dehumanizing effect. We note this readily in the robot-like treatment of workers in the assembly line, or the often-noted phenomenon of an individual in an advanced country cut off from all his roots in an atomized and fragmented society.


In the natural course of events man works to satisfy his physiological wants by the acquisition of material things; but, beyond a certain level of consumption, he seeks higher values in the form of psychic rewards or self-fulfilment. This drive for self-fulfilment can often be achieved only by a holistic development of the capabilities of an individual and of the various sectors of the community in which he lives. While the United Nations has rightfully been preoccupied with satisfying the material demands of the world, it is time we looked towards the future and defined those higher values which societies and man must seek as he strives for progress.


It is within this context that the Philippines at the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly proposed the inclusion of an item entitled New International Human Order: Moral Aspects of Development. It is the hope of my Government, in pursuing this initiative, that the world will look beyond the satisfaction of material wants, beyond the usual parameters of economic growth, and strive for the establishment of an international order which will consider man as the object rather than the subject of development.


The United Nations is indeed beset with numerous global problems, as we have indicated; but in the long run the survival of this body will rest on the ability of each Member nation to maintain domestic stability. In our interdependent world, instability in one country can easily be exported to its neighbours.


While the political reforms in my country that I adverted to earlier cannot by themselves ensure domestic stability, they will be meaningless in the face of widespread economic deprivation. Therefore we are happy to note that the steps we have taken during the past two years are now leading towards a complete national economic recovery. The economic slide, which just a few months ago was cited by critics of our Government as presaging the imminent economic collapse of our country, has been reversed. We achieved this dramatic turn-around by pursuing a policy of fiscal restraint and monetary contraction. Our rate of inflation, which peaked at 63 per cent in the latter part of 1984, has been reduced to around 12 per cent; consequently, economic productivity has been stimulated. By the end of this year we are confident that it will be down to a single digit level.


On the fiscal side, we have reduced our budget deficit to 1.8 per cent of our gross national product. This reduced deficit was achieved by pursuing a policy of fiscal restraint on governmental expenditures. At the same time, we were able to collect more taxes by the efficient administration of existing tax laws and by broadening our tax base by eliminating tax exemptions.


During the first six months of this year we experienced a balance-of-payments surplus of $2.5 billion. This figure is a dramatic turnaround from the $1.8 billion deficit we experienced in 1984 and the $2.7 billion shortfall in 1983. The deficit in our balance of trade has likewise decreased from $316 million in the first half of 1983 to $261 million in the first half of this year. We achieved this reduction notwithstanding the depressed prices for most of our primary export products. Our imports for 1984 were 12.6 per cent lower than in 1983.


Recognizing the scarcity of foreign exchange at the moment, we have changed our development strategy from the establishment of capital-intensive heavy industries in favour of a more balanced agro-industrial development. Our policy of giving incentives to the development of export-oriented industries has resulted in the diversification of our exports. In 1960, for example, only 4 per cent of our total exports were non-traditional in the form of manufactured or semi-manufactured goods. By 1980 our non-traditional exports expanded to 36 per cent of our total exports, increasing further to 58 per cent in 1984. In our drive to increase our foreign exchange earnings to meet our developmental needs, we have also tapped other sources of invisible earnings, such as tourism and the remittances from our workers abroad.


All these statistics on economic growth and recovery will be meaningless, however, if the wealth accumulated by a country remains concentrated in the hands of a few. Even more important than the increase in a countrys wealth as indicated by the growth of its gross national product is the overriding question of how this wealth is redistributed. In other words, who benefits from this growth?


Our recent performance on this score is noteworthy. The share in income of the bottom 60 per cent of the families in our society increased from 21.7 per cent to 22.9 per cent between 1981 and 1983, or by 1.2 per cent in two years.


This incremental gain may not appear large at first glance. Nonetheless its significance is not lost on our people. It confirms that the policies we have pursued all these years are headed in the right direction  towards the goal of an egalitarian and democratic society that we all envision for our people.


The Philippines has managed to overcome all its problems owing mainly to the continuing partnership between our people and our Government in meeting challenges that threaten our national existence. The prevalent view during the last two years, fanned in no small measure by foreign media, is that our Government has lost the confidence of its people and that our country is undergoing a crisis of legitimacy.


It gives me pleasure to state in this august forum that the most recent poll conducted by the Businessmen-Bishops Conference, an organization known for its independent views, totally belies this claim. The results of its nation-wide survey revealed that 44 per cent of our citizens approved of the performance of President Marcos and that only 25 per cent were in disagreement; the reliability of this survey has not been questioned by the numerous opposition parties.


Given the continued trust of our people in the ability of our present leaders to meet the continuing challenges of our time, the Philippines looks forward to the future with confidence.


Our main goal remains that of development which, in the words of His Holiness Pope Paul VI is the other term for peace. We shall pursue this goal, relying in the main on our resources and on the industry and innate ability of our people, through self-reliance.


But we shall at the same time always consider ourselves as part of the global community. When President Marcos assumed the presidency of the Philippines in 1965 he ruled out an inward-looking and xenophobic approach to development. He selected instead a strategy that would link our national economy to the global economy. Consistent with this vision we have recognized the importance of foreign investments and we have correspondingly assigned specific roles for foreign participation in our development, as spelled out in our investment priorities programme. We therefore look forward to sharing the benefits of international prosperity while contributing our own share towards its attainment.


We shall pursue and achieve our development goals under a system of orderly change, which will not destabilize our society and, ultimately, those of our neighbours. In our interdependent world, instability in one country is transmitted quickly to other areas.


President Ferdinand E. Marcos, in his book entitled *The Filipino Ideology*, said that:


We shall continue to support the United Nations in the firm conviction that this world Organization remains our only hope for international peace.


Unfolding before us are new roles for the United Nations system as the world knocks at the threshold of the twenty-first century. Increasing international contacts and the growing interdependence of nations require new forms of co-operation even as new problems complicate the fate of humanity. The failures of old structures and programmes open the door to the new age. The idealism of the young and their determination to participate in building a better world are vital elements necessary to strengthen the United Nations system and prepare it better for the widening dimensions of its responsibilities.


The United Nations remains the primary guardian of mans universal conscience and the preserver of its ultimate significance. Despite its idealism, or perhaps because of it, this Organization is still mankinds best hope for peace and progress. As long as the United Nations exists, mans dream of and work for a world of peace, prosperity and freedom stand a better chance of fulfilment. It is infinitely desirable that we keep this Organization a living and dynamic body ever responsive to the needs and aspirations of mankind. We can do no less for our sake and for that of future generations.


That is why I should like to end my statement with a quotation from our esteemed Secretary-General, Don Javier Prez de Cullar, who has reminded us all that:


A great effort of will and intelligence is going to be needed to build a system which will effectively preserve peace and which will work in the interests of all peoples of this Earth.


May he therefore continue to persevere in his Herculean task that has been the dream of mankind since the dawn of civilization.


Long live the United Nations."	1985-10-10
Corazon C. Aquino	UNGA 41	"It is the irony of the United Nations that so many new leaders have stepped to this rostrum, as I have today, with mixed feelings. Yes, we took power to implement so many of the ideals that the United Nations stands for. We have restored human rights and liberated our people from the oppression and corruption of a Government that had long since lost their support. Yet, like so many other leaders before me, I am obliged to say that we did that by ourselves. It was the Filipino people alone who braved intimidation and cheating at the polls and, when their victory was stolen from them, turned out into the streets by the million to reclaim and secure it. Indeed, as our country bled at the hands of a government that had lost all respect for the rights of our people, its leader's wife came to this rostrum to call piously for a new human order - this when thousands of Filipinos were political prisoners. 


And in the final months of the dictatorship international solidarity was expressed by ordinary people everywhere, who sat in front of their television sets and watched and cheered our revolution. In this year of all years, when in so many parts of the world we see people struggling to establish their human rights, I believe one must be frank to be relevant. I mean to use this occasion to share with oppressed people everywhere my own experience of how change is brought about. My basic conclusion can be stated very simply: to be free one can, as a people, effectively appeal to international standards of human rights set by others, such as the United Nations. Yet, in the end, to vindicate those rights, to achieve freedom, one is on one's own. The United Nations has stayed out of the internal affairs of nations. Its Charter orders that that should be so. Obviously this is wise in so far as it prevents abuse of the sovereign independence of nations. Yet it has also been an invitation to hypocrisy. 


The value of this Assembly should rest on us, its members, practising what we preach. To my mind, that requires both realism and concern when we address the affairs of others, realism in that we should not promise more than we can deliver, We should acknowledge what the Filipino people have learned: there is no substitute for action by an oppressed people themselves. But there should be concern about allowing this Hall to be abused by those who claim one standard of behaviour and behave according to another back home. 


Do not misunderstand me. The United Nations should never be an exclusive club for one ideological model, for that would defeat its primary purpose, to keep peace in an imperfect world. There are many ways to run a country, but there is only one way to treat people: with decency and respect for their uniqueness as individuals. Only if those of us who have the responsibility of leadership respect our fellows and their essential right to find fulfilment in their lives can we hold our heads high here at the United Nations. The United Nations would lose all purpose if it were to set about judging one political system against another. Yet, equally, if the United Nations does not notice how governments treat people, it is nothing. I need only go back to the rousing words of the United Nations Charter. The United Nations is about people. If it fails them, can it be any better than its most corrupt and oppressive Member State? Even diplomacy, which is pre-eminently about States, cannot ignore, without peril or embarrassment, how States treat their people. 


And so, as the leader of a country which has this year enjoyed the sweet taste of freedom, again let me reconfirm our support for what the United Nations at its best stands for: the peace, freedom, dignity and partnership of mankind. But let me also at the same time serve warning to those denied freedom and dignity: do not look beyond yourselves to find them. We in the Philippines were strengthened in our resolve by knowing that people around the world shared our struggle. On their televisions and in their newspapers, they followed our drama. 


Further, we know that the rights we fought for are universally Sought after; they are enshrined = not entombed, mind you - in the United Nations Covenants. The importance of such international support should never be dismissed. It helped us knowing we were not alone. But even when the authors of the United Nations Charter stopped short of endorsing any right of interference in any nation's internal affairs, they were responding to more than the jealous realities of intergovernmental relations. Rather, they were reflecting a more lasting truth abou. how man prefers to order his life on this planet. People must be masters of their own fate. The Filipino people have known and been grateful for liberation at the hands of others: in 1898, a liberation that was swiftly betrayed, and in 1946, one which we promptly wasted. 


Yet now, having known the exhilaration of throwing off our bonds ourselves, I think every Filipino would agree there is only one real liberation. Only a people, already sovereign in their hearts and deeds, can win and keep their independence and freedom. This is not a pessimistic conclusion because, additionally, I believe that no government can indefinitely resist a people united against it. . It may have the guns, the goons and the gold. Yet, as we found in the Philippines, there is no government that can indefinitely resist a people determined to be free. 


And so, while the United Nations may not intervene to bring the sovereignty and freedom enjoyed by nations to the peoples who are denied them, it should carefully avoid becoming an unwitting partner of their oppressors. I turn now specifically to the great moral issue that confronts this General Assembly: the situation in South Africa. To Nelson Mandela and his wife, Winnie, and all South Africans, my prayers are with you. Mr. Mandela's long incarceration in prison, separated from his wife and family, inevitably reminds me of the imprisonment of my own husband, Ninoy Aquino.


The lesson in my country and so many other places such as Argentina, whose President Alfonsin recently visited Manila, is that every act of repression reaps its final return. In the end, human values cannot be held down. They could not be in Argentina; they could not be in the Philippines. They will not be in South Africa. It is right that we all play our part in creating the environment for change in South Africa. The Philippines will support any action the international community takes to hasten the advent of peace and freedom in South Africa and to show solidarity with its people. But it would help the case a great deal if this forum were to take equal note and action against oppression wherever it occurs, wherever people are abused and degraded, be it blatantly or ostensibly in their own name. I do not believe that the force of moral action is diminished by being spread wherever it is needed. It is strengthened by exercise and weakened by neglect. . Let me say directly to the millions of victims of apartheid in South Africa, to the families of those who have given their lives: do not waiver in your unity; look only to your own strength and determination. 


If there is one tactic that served us above all others in our movement for freedom, it was espousing a programme of action that kept us united. In our case, this meant the use of non-violence and constant vigilance against the provocation of the authorities. Often, I was urged to go further: to call for a more confrontational line. But my constant concern was to keep the wide coalition of forces that backed our campaign together. Often, I disappointed some of my supporters by approving only limited actions against the Government. Yet it was the rock-like unity of the opposition and the enormous support it enjoyed that overwhelmed the Government. That meant not going faster than any of our supporters were prepared to go. This allowed us to overcome where more narrow-based opposition challenges had failed to dislodge the dictatorship.


Perhaps the United Nations cannot go faster than its most reluctant Member towards its stated goals of peace, freedom and dignity for the peoples of all nations. An perhaps, for its more significant achievement, we should look rather to the peace it has helped preserve, and the co-operation it has fostered, between nations already friends, than to the peace it has failed to keep between nations bent on war. In the same light should we regard the salutary influence of its freedom-practising members in the counsels of the world. Even so, I have come to appreciate the achievement of our own regional organization, the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). ASEAN's faltering steps towards economic co-operation and complementation, in the name of peace and stability in the region, are meant to serve and express the abiding peace and amity among its members that were there from the start.


To nurture a vigorous peace wherever it abides and strengthen long-standing friendships: perhaps this is all that it lies in the power of international organizations to do. I have always been a firm advocate of peace. Perhaps it is only the tragedy of conflict that teaches us the true value of peace. Let us who are the loyal friends of peace continue to resist the temptation to exploit the conflicts of our neighbours. Those of us in ASEAN understand the crucial importance of these goals. 


Each of our countries has passed through periods of crisis when great rifts of weakness have appeared, yet none of the others, for all our differences in political systems and beliefs, has exploited the occasion; on the contrary, they have risen to it with encouraging expressions of sympathy and offers of help and mediation, ever respectful of the integrity of their tragic neighbour. And so my message today is an effort to bring this mission of the United Nations into sharper focus to the end that there shall be no more disappointments over unwarranted expectations. There will be no more wasted hopes on the part of those who must save their strength for the long and difficult struggle for peace and freedom. There will be, on the other hand, a clearer recognition by the United Nations of its irreducible commitments and values, a more jealous regard for their integrity and, for that reason, perhaps, a surer prospect of achieving the United Nations goals of peace, freedom, dignity and the partnership of mankind."	1986-09-23
Manuel T. Yan	UNGA 42	"I wish, Sir, to convey to you the felicitations of the people and Government of the Philippines on your unanimous election as President of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. You bring to that high office outstanding qualifications and long experience in diplomacy, particularly in the United Nations. It is therefore especially appropriate that you should be leading our deliberations in this critical period in the history of the United Nations, and it is with great confidence that we look forward to your stewardship of the General Assembly.


I should like, at the same time, to congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, who provided able and effective leadership during the forty-first session.


I wish also to pay tribute to the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his painstaking efforts on behalf of peace in the world. His annual report highlights the major issues before the Organization and contains important recommendations which should guide us in our deliberations.


Throughout the more than 40 years of existence of the United Nations the Assembly's agenda has been focused on the quest of man for a world order based on peace, harmony, security and prosperity. Although the Assembly meets every year, the unique service of this forum is today more important than ever, for today the international community is confronted with a serious crisis of confidence in the collective ability of nations to move together towards a common goal. Despite tne many approaches that have been tried in recent years, the causes of world conflicts have not disappeared. Indeed, these conflicts could become worse as the political will to solve them ebbs. At the same time, every effort to turn each crisis into opportunity generates the momentum towards the elusive goals of genuine peace and prosperity.


The Philippines comes to the forty-second session of the General Assembly under a new mandate and inspiration. The Filipino people have ratified a new Constitution by which they hope to build a just and humane society and pursue their ideals and aspirations under the rule of law in a regime of truth, justice, freedom, love, equality and peace. In our relations with the international community we give paramount consideration to safeguarding our national sovereignty and territorial integrity and to respecting the right to self-determination of all. nations. We have renounced war as an instrument of national policy and adopted the generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of the land.


In pursuit of our programme of national reconstruction we convened, following a general election, a new Congress of the Philippines that is truly representative of the people and committed to giving meaning and reality to their will.


My delegation is deeply touched by and grateful for the many expressions of sympathy and support for the Philippines and the Government of President Aquino which have been heard in this Assembly.


With its new set of credentials, the Philippines seeks to fulfil its international responsibility and contribute to the common effort to build a better world for ourselves and our children. This universal aspiration is embodied in the objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations. Although the international community has committed itself to these objectives in the resonant language of repeated declarations, we remain fragmented and are often in conflict, independently pursuing our individual interests and preferring to rely on the security and comfort of our respective national shells.


The world is waking up to the erosion of many traditional premises, which are not being replaced by new principles upon which to base the resolution of our difficulties. As decision-makers faced with the responsibility of managing these challenges we must find, through discussion and by means of concerted action, new answers to age-old problems. It is our duty to construct a new system of international relations based on the reality of growing and genuine interdependence and on the principles of justice and equity that will both respond to our collective interests and permit us to achieve our respective national objectives.


The first element in this noble mission is the maintenance of international peace and security.


Modern history has recorded the failure of innumerable attempts to stabilize the level of armaments of the world Powers. Today, in an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion and in the face of an ever escalating arms race, the superpowers wrangle in a tug-of-war of gambit and rejection, while the rest of the world watches in horror lest the hair-trigger situation explode into a holocaust. worse still, the danger is being carried over to outer space, which, as mankind's common heritage, should be reserved exclusively for the uses of peace. Meanwhile, scarce resources that could be utilized for improving the lives of the peoples and fulfilling the potential of the nations of the world are being dissipated.


It is ironic that the Powers involved in the arms race are the very same nations as are entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining peace and security within the United Nations system. In this context, the Philippines welcomes the fact that the United States and the Soviet Union have reached agreement in principle to eliminate intermediate-range missiles. We hope that this will be followed by an agreement to reduce, if not eliminate, intercontinental systems.


We also encourage progress towards and agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union for the reduction of strategic arsenals at the levels which they set last year in Reykjavik. These are vital steps in the continuing effort towards the goal of ensuring a safer world for mankind.


Conflicts and disputes of various kinds rend the fabric of peace in some regions of the world. These conflicts result as much from a fundamental lack of respect for the rights of men and nations as from the prejudice, arrogance and greed that motivate the disregard of these rights.


In South-East Asia the hapless nation of Kampuchea is in the grip of a military occupation that continues to be a threat to the peace and stability of the region. The political sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kampuchea have been violated, and violence has been inflicted on the dignity of its people. Thousands of refugees have been driven across national borders and now live under the most difficult conditions.


The Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), to which the Philippines belongs in solidarity of purpose, has worked tirelessly for a durable and comprehensive political settlement that will restore peace, freedom, independence and justice to the Kampuchean people and stability in the region. In this, ASEAN has received the support of the overwhelming majority of nations, support expressed in particular, in resolutions approved by large majorities in the General Assembly.


Together with its ASEAN partners, the Philippines welcomes the recent agreement to hold an informal meeting, initially among Kampucheans and subsequently with the participation of Viet Nam. We hope that this meeting will be the beginning of a dialogue that will eventually lead to negotiations and ultimately to a solution to the problem of Kampuchea.


It will be a solution, we trust, from which will emerge a Kampuchea whose destiny is determined by its own people, free from outside interference, a Kampuchea that is independent, neutral and non-aligned, headed by leaders of the Kampucheans' own choosing. At the same time the solution should take into account the security and other interests of all the countries concerned.


It is precisely such a solution that is envisioned in the draft resolution that is to be submitted under the agenda item, ""The situation in Kampuchea"". By again voting in favour of this resolution, therefore, Member states will be helping to hasten the settlement of the Kampuchean conflict. We must emphasize once again that an acceptable and enduring settlement must include the realization of this proposition: Viet Nam must leave Kampuchea.


In the same manner, the world expects from the Powers concerned a positive response in respect of Afghanistan. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan must be upheld and all foreign forces there must be withdrawn. Afghan refugees must be returned to their homes in safety and honour. The Afghan people must be left alone to determine their own form of government and their own economic, political and social system, free from outside intervention.


The Philippines has taken note of the efforts at national reconciliation in Afghanistan and of the pronouncements on the withdrawal of foreign troops from the country. However, we believe that these steps fall short of the principles embodied in General Assembly resolution 4~33, which calls for the immediate and total withdrawal of foreign troops.


Foreign troops must leave Afghanistan. As great a tragedy on the contemporary scene is the plight of Namibia, capti~ of a racist regime that for the last 21 years has defied all calls from the Security Council and the General Assembly to withdraw from Namibia. South Africa continues to violate the human rights and dignity of the Namibians, plunders Namibia's natural resources, and denies the country its independence and rightful place in the family of nations.


South Africa must leave Namibia. South Africa must set Namibia free. A state of genuine peace, harmony and stability is possible under conditions that recognize and respect the dignity of man. What evil force drives South Africa to defy the whole world bewilders the civilized mind. History does not have to pass judgement on South Africa. Humanity, confronted with the gravest of moral issues - that is, apartheid - has already judged it. The judgment must be executed. There must be an end to the attempt to shield South Africa from the world's anger on the basis of any excuse or rationalization. The imposition of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the. Charter is the only peaceful means available to create the necessary environment of change. This is imperative and urgent.


The Security Council's unanimous call in resolution 598 (1987) of 20 July 1987 for a cease-fire in the eight-year-old war between Iran and Iraq must be upheld. NO effort should be spared to prevent the worsening of a war nobody wants. My delegation supports the Secretary-General's efforts on behalf of peace in the Persian Gulf.


The Middle East conflict has remained a tinderbox for too long. A just, comprehensive and lasting settlement must be achieved if we are to eliminate a major cause of international instability. The right of the Palestinian people to self-determination under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization and to establish an independent State in Palestine must be recognized. At the same time, the right of all States in the region to live in peace and within secure boundaries, free from threats or acts of force, must be upheld. The convening under the auspices of the United Nations of an international peace conference on the Middle East with the participation of all parties concerned and the five permanent members of the Security Council would be a most appropriate means for the resolution of the conflict.


We pay a tribute to the Central American countries for the historic agreement which they recently reached in Guatemala City. It augurs well for the peace, security and stability of that troubled region. It also speaks well of a political will founded on wisdom and statesmanship. We call on all the countries concerned to carry out this landmark agreement.


My delegation supports the resumption of negotiations on the Korean question at the earliest possible time. In keeping with the principle of universality and for the sake of international peace and stability, the Philippines supports the admission to membership of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the United Nations under Article 4 of the Charter. The disputes in the Malvinas and in Western Sahara call for similar approaches. Efforts leading to their effective resolution, both direct negotiations and use of the good offices of the Secretary-General, must be encouraged.


The United Nations must take the lead in reversing the worsening global economic situation. Our hope for enduring global peace, harmony and security cannot be realized in a world beset with glaring economic inequity and injustice, which create serious instabilities in many areas of the world. What is required is for us to go beyond rhetoric and take action.


We are, after all, not starting from scratch. There are principles and courses of action that have long been embodied in many declarations, joint communiques, resolutions and decisions of the United Nations. We already have the Programme of Action for a New International Economic Order, the United Nations International Development Strategies, the Vienna Programme of Action for Science and Technology, and many more. However, there has been some unwillingness to give practical application to those instruments. If the international community had done what is called for in those instruments, we would be living in a better world than we have today.


We are aware of the obstacles that lie ahead of us. The reluctance of the industrialized nations to undertake appropriate industrial restructuring prevents world trade from regaining its buoyancy. The general slow-down in the flow of development resources from bilateral sources and international financial institutions deprives the developing countries, particularly the debt-ridden among them, of the means to achieve economic growth.


Trade protectionism constitutes a frustrating barrier to the developing nations' economic aspirations. Their foreign debt is a crushing burden on those countries, bringing about great social and political tensions in their societies. The ad hoc and piecemeal management of the debt problem has been anti-development, destabilizing and inequitable. While there is a growing recognition of the principle of shared responsibility of debtors and creditors, the actual burden has been borne primarily, if not entirely, by the debtor countries, for which the costs of adjustment are intolerably onerous.


My delegation believes that economic growth must take precedence over debt servicing. Developing countries must have a reasonable economic growth that will enable their peoples to enjoy adequate standards of living. The long-term interests of the creditors are better served by the continued stability of the debtor countries and the viability of the global financial system. The Philippines therefore supports a proposal to convene an international conference on money and finance to discuss a just and lasting solution to the debt problem. We are called upon to take bold steps and innovative approaches in the political and economic spheres to meet the challenges of today. We are also called upon to take concerted action and respond to the mandate in the Preamble of the United Nations Charter ""to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.""


No effort to improve the quality of life can have meaning apart from the general well-being of the human person. The impairment of social life, the threat of disease, poverty and malnutrition, and the outrages that injure or violate the dignity of the human person could render ineffective, even meaningless, whatever gains are made in other fields.


Last year the General Assembly adopted 68 resolutions on social, cultural and humanitarian matters. They encompass the promotion and protection of human rights, the International Campaign Against Abuse of and Illegal Trafficking in Drugs, women, youth, the disabled and the aging, crime prevention and criminal justice, racism, racial discrimination, and the right to self-determination. The resolutions provide the building blocks that have resulted in a number of United Nations treaties and conventions. Thus, the United Nations has done much in setting standards by which the Member countries can measure their performance. We, the Members of the United Nations, must match our zeal with concrete proposals, resolutions and decisions and place our collective determination and political will behind their implementation.


The Philippine Government remains steadfast in its adherence to human rights and social justice and in the commitment of the new Constitution to giving the ""highest priority to the enactment of measures that protect and enhance the right of the people to human dignity, reduce social, economic and political inequalities, and remove cultural inequities by equitably diffusing wealth and political power for the common good."" We place the highest value on those United Nations instruments which promote and protect human dignity and the worth of the individual.


To the extent that the United Nations has become the guardian of the highest moral values of humanity, the promotion and protection of human rights must keep its place high on the United Nations agenda. And, even as we keep vigilant watch over the conduct of individual Governments, we must constantly urge one another to renew our commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the other instruments in this field.


To signify the Philippine Government's unwavering support of the international struggle against apartheid, President Aquino recently signed, in the presence of General Joseph Garba, Chairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid, the instrument of ratification of the International Convention against Apartheid in Sports.


The United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment entered into force on 26 June of this year. The Convention represents a major step forward towards the world-wide proscription of torture. However, our intent to promote and protect human rights must be accompanied by an earnest effort to carry out our corresponding obligations. We are encouraged by the efforts of the United Nations system to integrate women into the mainstream of national life by emphasizing that women are active participants in development as well as prime beneficiaries of its rewards. My country strongly supports the work of the United Nations on behalf of the advancement of women. We take pride in the fact that the Nairobi forward-looking strategies for the advancement of women to the year 2000 have been included in the Philippines' medium-term development plan for 1987-1992.


During this session the United Nations will observe the tenth anniversary of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). UNIFEM has contributed much to the improvement of the situation of the poor in more than 100 countries around the world. We must therefore continue to support it fully.


The International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, under the presidency of the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, which was held in Vienna in June, was a landmark development in international co-operation in meeting the grave challenge of the drug problem. The Declaration and the comprehensive multi-disciplinary outline should lay the groundwork for further co-operation. The Philippines will continue to pursue the fight against that scourge, both at home and on the international front, particularly in collaboration with its partners in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). In its latest compilation, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 58,880 cases of AIDS. The Philippines views with concern the ever-increasing number of victims of that dreaded disease and is therefore prepared to support concerted joint efforts aimed at combating it.


One of the most important documents that will be discussed by the General Assembly this year is the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, entitled ""Our common future"". The Philippines was privileged to attend the presentational meeting to launch the report, which was held in New York in July 1987.


The realities of living on one Earth make us realize the constraints of the interdependency of our environments and economies. Unfortunately, the international community has not effectively addressed our urgent ecological concerns. Scientists throughout the world have brought to our attention the urgent but complex environmental problems threatening our survival. A warming globe, threats to the ozone layer, desertification, deforestation, pollution and environmental degradation are eroding the potential for development and have become a survival issue for developing countries.


Let us recall with relief and gratitude that the forty-first session of the General Assembly ended with a renewed awareness of the need to overcome a looming crisis of confidence in the United Nations and to keep it moving forward despite a serious challenge to its very existence.


The difficult situation created by the financial crisis in the United Nations system last year resulted in an unexpected bonus; it gave rise to a pervasive spirit of moderation and sobriety, which culminated in an earnest search for compromise and accommodation.


It is imperative for the entire membership to accept joint responsibility for keeping the United Nations not only alive and well but strong enough to face the tasks that have been entrusted to it. Obligations under the Charter must be met under the mandated arrangement of equitable burden-sharing based on capacity. The financial problem will remain and perhaps grow worse for as long as commitments are not honoured.


The administrative reforms directed by this Assembly and carried out by the Secretary-General should meet the requirements of rationalization and the need to streamline management. There is encouraging progress in the effort to review the Charter so as to strengthen the United Nations and make it a more effective instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security. The vision that emerged for all mankind in 1945 in San Francisco will remain as a beacon in our quest for a better life in a world at peace. It is less important to know whether in the interval we have moved an inch closer to our goal than it is to make certain that our sense of co1M1itment and responsibility has not diminished. The important thing is not to falter and not to surrender to cynicism and despair, for if we are today a community of nations risen from the scourge of wars and deprivation it is because of our awareness that we can gather strength from a sense of solidarity and are nourished by a real faith in the vision of a bright future for mankind as we bestride the short distance into the twenty-first century."	1987-10-02
Raul S. Manglapus	UNGA 43	"The Philippines greets you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. It is not only the votes of the membership of this body, but your own erudition, experience and diplomatic skills and your country's brilliant contributions to this Organization that have elevated you to that exalted office. My delegation awaits the impact of your shining leadership on the labours of the Assembly. 


You succeed Mr. Peter Florin, the President at the forty-second session of the General Assembly, and the Philippines appreciates his performance in that capacity. It was a performance that was at once vigorous and unselfish. We recall that he returned to New York several times to preside over our resumed sessions and at one special session, which attests to his commitment as well as to his diplomacy. 


I brought the General Assembly a message from the poor of my country. 


Why are many Filipinos poor? 


They are not poor because they come from an indolent race. Our countrymen now cover the earth - two million of us in the Americas, half a million in the Middle East, a quarter of a million in Europe, half a million in Asia and the Pacific - seekers all of toil and of life, teachers of nations, physicians of men, builders of industry, designers of modules that challenge the stars and settle on the moon, men and women of skill and diligence, like those of Europe who settled America and here built a new world. 


They are not poor because they do not know how to fight for their rights. They were the first in Asia to shed their blood against Western colonialism and produce their own republic. Ninety years later, they were the first nation in the world to mass by the millions, to confront guns with rosaries and bring down a dictator without the shedding of blood. In those four bloodless, spectacular days of February, under the leadership of Corazon C. Aquino, they raised the new peaceful rallying cry of People power which even now resonates in the streets of nations in transition on more than one continent of this earth. 


They are not poor because they multiply too fast. They try not to, against their own human instincts. And they know that in rich nations it is the building of cities and industries, not the extermination of human instincts, that has reduced this multiplication. 


They are not poor because their nation does not grow. But our country does grow. Now that we are free again, although we remain harassed by the extremes of left and right, we have kept to our democratic course and our economy is growing again, last year by 5.6 per cent, this year by 6.8. 


Why, then, do so many of us remain poor? 


Thirty years ago, our country was second in East Asia in economic development, next only to Japan. Twenty years ago, along with those developing countries you now call the South, we were growing faster than the developed countries of the North. 


Then one day the countries that produce oil decided to form a cartel. And why not? Other countries more powerful than they had deprived them of their just profits and it was time that they stood up, joined forces and assumed control of the wealth that could had given them. 


We in the South who do not produce oil waited for the new oil alliance to share their profits with us. Yet they did not. The South was not ready with the mechanism to attract and absorb these profits. 


Therefore, the oil producers chose instead to store their gains in the bank vaults of the North.  The petrodollar was born, and the bankers of the North opened their doors wide to the money-famished financial planners of the South, including those of my country. We started to borrow, borrow, borrow, enticed by abundant funds and low interest rates. 


Some countries learned to control themselves, to borrow just enough, to use their borrowed money wisely and begin to grow. 


But for our leaders the lure of more and easy borrowing was too strong. 


Then one day a dictator seized power in our country. There was no more legal opposition, no free press to question enormous, hasty loans. Absolute power produced absolute corruption. The petrodollar was recycled back to the North in the bank deposits of the dictator and his friends. 


No one warned us of the cataclysm that had to follow. Instead, a banker from the North said to us: ""Do not worry. Sovereign countries never go bankrupt. 


And so, indeed, they lent us more and more. These debts were at that time guaranteed by the Government of the debtors. And sovereign Governments never disappear. They just change hands. 


Thus it was that in 1970, our country and those of the South owed only $100 billion dollars to the North. Ten years later, we owed $500 billion. Now we owe $1 trillion.


It was our Mexican friends who were first to realize it could go no further. They produced oil but its value went down triben the cartel collapsed and industry decided on other ways of fuelling itself. Mexico said: We have no money. we cannot pay.  And the South woke up to the realities of borrowing. 


The banks of the North began to say: We have been lending too much, even more than 20 times our capital. And so now we must pay more for every dollar we borrow, and there are less of those dollars to borrow. And so, after we were titillated into a borrowing pattern - nay, a borrowing spree - the spigot is turned off. 


Up to 1981 the money was coming into our countries: now it is going out. Now we of the South must together send out $20 billion more than we are receiving every year from our international creditars. Last year alone our country sent out $7 billion more than it received. 


Our country must now export much more and import much less just to earn the money with which to pay our debt. Yet, what do some of our friends of the North do? They make it harder for us to export. When they decide that we are exporting enough, they want us to restrain ourselves. When our exports displease their labour, they cut them down. When we export the fruits of our soil, they demand health certificates. When we export what we manufacture, they decide that our products are not good enough. When they cannot say that our products are not good enough, they say it is our packaging that is no good. And when we have done everything to please them, they inundate us with customs documentation. 


When the countries of the North want to export their service industries to ustheir insurance, their banking, their financethey ask us for market access, national treatment, right of establishment. Yet, are the market services of the North open to the South? If it is their services, they call it exports. If it is our services, they call it immigration. 


So many of our factories, unable to export more, to import enough of the raw material that they needed for their productsv shut down many of their machines. By 1985, 600,000 in our country had lost their jobs this way. In despair many were tempted to join the rebels in the mountains; many who understood and who saw that death by bullet could be less painful than death by debt. But, though many are starving, they have faith in the ways of peace, which are the ways of the nations united in this Assembly. 


This then is the message I bring to the Assembly from the poor of my country. It is the same message from the poor of the world, the poor who suffer, but who want peace, not violence. It is a message of hope, not of despair. How do we respond? 


As Polonius advised his son Laertes: 


""Neither a borrower, nor a lender be, 

For loan oft loses both itself and friend, 

And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry."" (Hamlet, I; iii) 


Shakespeares admonition may have its relevance for an adolescent who is about to set out on his own, but it has no appeal for a young nation that must growl must build, must stoke its furnaces with the resources of other nations. 


Yet borrowing can be heady stuff for eager nations and avid lending houses, and the point of crisis is not difficult to reach. Debt crises are not new in this century, and they have not been beyond solution. In fact, when the crisis is bilateral and horizontal, between North and North, lessens have been learned in time and new disasters averted. 


At Versailles in 1919 the victorious Allies of the First World war refused to condone the enervating obligations of the defeated Germans, and Germany went to the radical right for a solution. That solution produced the Second World War. The Allies, again victorious in 1945, remembered Versailles, and in London, forgave 70 per cent of the German debt. The same bold visionary leadership that executed that condooation also conceived the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 


But when it is a multilateral and vertical crisis, between North and South, the condonations come much more slowly and painfully. There was one such crisis in the 1930s. At that time the creditor countries refused condonation and most debtor countries responded quickly and simply. They refused to pay their debts. A few Power to enforce international contracts. When most of the debtors refused to pay, for the rest of the debtors no sanction was to be feared. There was no hegemonic did pay, like Argentina, where British leverage could administer sanctions. But the world economy did not collapse. The debtors could not pay and the oredi tor Governments chose to look the other way. There was only the impulse to create the institutions that would prwide the framework for international economic relations. 


There is one hegemonic Power today that could crack the whip; the United Statea of America. But the crisis is enormous and there are rising economic powers with which the enforcer must coordinate if order and resolution are to be reached. This is not happening. Today the fund well is dry and there have followed recession and inflation. The response of most creditor countries has been to tighten monetary policy and reduce trade deficits. And so the cost of debt has increased. 


For its part, the United States has opted for supply-side economics, continuing budget deficits, reducing tax rates and expanding the economy. In the North there has followed turmoil in interest rates, as well as unemployment, which is now being blamed on imper ts from the South. 


The South is now being asked to undertake structural reforms and to rely more on the market and the private sector. But the North with all its technology could solve its unemployment problem, not by blaming imports from the South, but by getting out of economic activities in which the North has no economic advantage: textiles, garments, shoes. 


We repeat our salute last week to President Ronald Reagan's veto of the protectionist textile Bill. That masterful act of principled determination was a signal of hope for justice in international free trade and of faith in international negotiations and institutions. 


We also applaud Japan, which has offered to recycle $30 billion of its annual surplus by supporting export industries in developing countries. But for this to pursue and to know this they must also know what structural transformations can take place in the North. But for this strategy to succeed the developing countries must know what it would be profitable The debt crisis is not a problem only for the debtor; it is a problem for the creditor; it is a problem for the world. Therefore, the solution cannot be sectoral~ it must be total. It cannot be regional~ it must be global. It cannot be technocratic) it must be political.


Economic and finance ministers of the world must confer. That is vital. But that is not sufficient. The men and women who make political policy--it is these who must agree on the final resolution of this global tragedy.


In this last year, in many capitals of the world, political policy-makers of this stature have met and called for valiant responses but have not yet found formal decisive consensus\ in Manila last December at the summit of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Toronto last June at the summit of the Seven) again in Manila last June at the International Conference of Newly Restored Democracies) in Cyprus last month at the meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement.


How shall we resolve debt? It is valuable to reschedule debt. But it is even more precious and human to forgive debt. The makers of policy must agree to resolve the question, who is entitled to debt relief and debt forgiveness? Is it possible to fix standards rather than leave the answer to the strengths and weaknesses of negotiators?


They must agree to alternative adjustment programmes to promote growth that will suit both planned and free economies. They must also develop new modes to carry out global solutions. For the present mechanisms are not equipped for such a momentous mission.


The International Monetary Fund (IMF) approaches short-term problems, like balance of payments, with an average span of 18 months. But the structural and financial horizons of transnational debt can span a generation.


The World Bank has primarily concerned itself with financing projects, and, more recently, with programmes. Yet, it is only in the context of an aggregate panorama that the financial obligations of nations can be amply appreciated. It is now seven years that the debt crisis has been thundering across our planet. The assault is overwhelming us because our defences are isolated and our strategies fragmented. I propose a global oounter-attack by forces that will transcend geography and ideology.


I propose an international debt and development commission. I propose that this commission be constituted of men and women whom the world recognizes for their redoubtable seasoning in foreign policy, diplomacy, finance, political economy, trade and development. I propose that the Commission be provided not with a new bureaucracy but with a staff seconded from outstanding multilateral agencies I propose that the commission be rendered a life-span of five years.


I propose that this commission be mandated to evaluate alternative schemes for global debt management, move to concrete action to rectify the trading system consistent with that global debt management, formulate institutional changes in international agencies so that they may discharge a more comprehensive role in the process, commend specific actions to members Governments to address alternative schemes, oversee and monitor its own output.


I propose that the commission conduct its own study, but look into recent proposals on global debt management, including the report on an international debt management authority made by the Committee on Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs of the United States House of Representatives, and the French plan announced by President Franois Mitterrand.


I propose that with this mandate the commission develop standards under which debtor countries may qualify for debt relief or debt forgiveness; formulate alternative adjustment programmes that promote sustainable growth among nations accompanied by an expansion of their capacity to pay their debt; specify actions, such as the amending of bank laws, necessary for this growth; offer policy practices for industrial countries' newly industrializing economies, middle-income and low-income nations; identify precise interactions between debt, trade and growthwhlch require multilateral response.


I propose that this commission submit these measures to the United Nations for approval, proclamation and execution.


The United Nations has been demonstrating an expanding genius for waging triumphant campaigns for disengagement - in Afghanistan, in the Middle East, even as it is now engaged in promising peaceful actions in Kampuchea, Western Sahara and Namibia.


It is a tribute to this General Assembly, to the Security Council, to the Headquarters and agencies, to the secretariat, and perhaps above all to Javier Perez de Cuellar, that the United Nations has at last become validated in its avowed designation, not only as the forum, but indeed as the engine par excellence for peace.


Yet what is this debt crisis but a monstrous threat to peace? Pope Paul VI once stood on this very rostrum and proclaimed that development is another word for peace.


Debt, reasonable debt, even in the holy books, is sanctioned and is meant to develop man. But today the debt of nation to nation is not developing man. It is killing man.


The killing must be stopped, and only the nations of the world together can stop it. Stop it now or end the dream of peace in our time. Stop it now or answer to the generation of tomorrow for decimating the human numbers of the generation of today."	1988-10-04
Raul S. Manglapus	UNGA 44	"Before you began to occupy that exalted Seat, Mr. President, you were already discharging a noble international mandate, having presided for years over the Special Committee against Apartheid. Under your direction, the global counterattack against that insult to the race of man has gained signal victories. And now, there you are, Mr. President, a friend of the Filipinos, who visited us in 1987, a friend of our late martyr, Ninoy Aquino, having worked with him at Harvard. We Filipinos rejoice that it is you who will preside over this body of nations for the next 365 days.


And to Mr. Dante Caputo, the former Foreign Minister of Argentina, let me say how much our prediction of success for his presidency last year has been proved correct. His expert hand steered us through the proceedings without conflict, without incident, without delay. We had faith in him as an outstanding human leader, and he justified that faith.


(spoke in Spanish)


Filipinos can take added pride in the fact that Dante Caputo, our successful outgoing President, is a man who, like us, has his roots in the world of Hispanic culture.


(continued in English)


Last year, I came to this rostrum to bring the Assembly a message from the poor of my country. I said that they are poor not because they come from an indolent race. For, I said, our countrymen now cover the earth: 2 million of us in the Americas, half a million in the Middle East, a quarter of a million in Europe, half a million in Asia and the Pacific - seekers all of toil and life, teachers of nations, physicians of men, builders of industry, designers of modules that challenge the stars and settle on the moon, men and women of skill and diligence, like those of Europe who settled America and here built a new world.


I said they are poor not because they do not know how to fight for their rights. For they were the first in Asia to shed their blood against Western colonialism and produce their own republic. Ninety years later, they were the first nation in the world to mass by the millions to confront guns with rosaries and bring down a dictator without the shedding of blood. In those four bloodless, spectacular days of February they raised, under Corazon C. Aquino, the new peaceful rallying cry of people power, which even now is resonating, sometimes unsuccessfully, always gloriously, in the streets of nations in transition on more than one continent of this earth.


I said they are poor not because they multiply too fast. And they know that in rich nations it is the building of cities and industries, not the extermination Of human instincts, that has reduced this multiplication.


I said they are poor not because their nation does not grow. For our country does grow. Now that we are free again , although we remain harassed by the extremes of right and left, we have kept to our democratic course and our economy is growing again: last year by 6.8 per cent, last semester by 5.3 per cent.


They are poor, I said, because they have inherited an external debt from the dictator - now $30 billion - and in order to service it their country must divert about 20 per cent of its annual budget and send out annually $1.7 billion more than it receives. All these years the countries of the North have insisted that one may not talk of debt relief beyond the boardrooms of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Yet international debt forgiveness became a reality just about the time the IMF and the World Bank were born, for both these institutions were conceived by the same bold, victorious, visionary leadership that, remembering the stubborn mistake in 1919 at Versailles, forgave in 1947, in London, 70 percent of the German debt.


And so I called last year for the formation of an international debt and development commission in order to recapture that original vision. The Group of 77 responded quickly, and two resolutions were drafted. The first called on the Secretary-General of the United Nations to continue using his high offices towards a common understanding on a solution to the international external debt. That resolution was passed by the forty-third session of the General Assembly with only one member voting against, and one abstaining.


This year the second resolution, submitted as a draft decision by Tunisia on behalf of the Group of 77--the one calling for the establishment of the commission on debt and development that I had the privilege of proposing last year--is on the agenda of this Assembly. The draft decision calls upon this forty-fourth session of the General Assembly


""To establish, under the aegis of the Secretary-General, an Advisory Commission on Debt and Development composed of eminent persons from the academic, political and financial sectors with knowledge and experience in international finance, trade and development, to develop innovative approaches and evolve specific proposals related to all types of debt in order to solve the debt problem of developing countries in a manner consistent with their sustained growth and development."" (A/C.R/43/L.19).


The draft decision provides that ""Debtor and creditor interests shall be represented in the membership of the Commission, which shall take into account the need for appropriate geographical representation and regional balance."" (ibid.).


It commands that ""The Commission shall take into consideration the various existing studies and recommendations on the subject, including the views of the Secretary-General set out in his report entitled 'Towards a durable solution of the debt problem' and those expressed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in the Trade and Development Report, 1988."" (ibid.). Finally, it gives this Commission a life of three years and commands it to submit annual reports to the General Assembly. A commission of this kind was proposed by the non-aligned summit in Belgrade early this month.


The Assembly must adopt this draft decision, for the global attack on debt must be pressed. The Assembly must adopt it because you yourself, Mr. President, have articulated the economic, political and social consequences of the international debt. The Assembly must adopt it, for the time is come when original rigidities are yielding to flexibilities. In 1987 Japan suggested IMF-funded bonds to buy out debtors' loans. At the 1988 Toronto summit France proposed the forgiveness of debts of the poorest of the poor in the sub-Sahara. At the forty-third session of the General Assembly last year, French President Franois Mitterand proposed an IMF-guaranteed conversion of loans into bonds to reduce financial charges of debtor countries and urged creditor countries to finance this scheme. Last year, as we were delivering our opening statements in this Hall, the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States - at the annual IMF-World Bank meeting in Berlin - was standing firm against the use of international aid funds for private-debt reduction.


A week later, as I negotiated in Washington a review of the Philippine-United States military bases agreement, the same Secretary of the Treasury began to show flexibility. He agreed to the Philippine position that a portion of United States compensation money could be used for a debt-reduction component of the bases compensation package.


It was for us - and perhaps for all international debtors - a historic breakthrough, a budding promise of universal relief. Four months later, the bud blossomed into a full-fledged plan. On 10 March 1989 United States Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas Brady announced that plan, which allows - nay, encourages - the financing of international debt reduction and debt service by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.


Because of the plan, our Philippine negotiators may soon sign with private banks a debt-relief agreement that could be unprecedented. It will be voluntary, for the extent of debt relief is determined by the willingness of commercial banks to agree to substantial discounts en debts repaid. It will be a substantial debt reduction, possibly up to half of the debt to banks which choose to exit from our borrowing programme. And there will be new resources - up to $1 billion from the hard core of institutions that will continue to support us.


I spoke to the Assembly last year of our poor. They are still poor, and they are still there, but they may now look hopefully to new horizons. Flexible minds make new horizons possible. It is the flexible and creative mind of Secretary Brady, bending with the international reality, that has given us this new horizon.


It is, indeed, thank God, the new age of flexibillity. I saw it happening in the Soviet Union, too, last month, when I met with Mr. Gorbachev in Moscow, where flexibility is pronounced ~restroika and glasnost, and includes the ability to change, to admit past imperfections and to dream of new perfections.


Let us aid this new flexibility~ let us speed its momentum by providing it with global underpinnings, underpinnings which can emanate only from the peaceful processes of the United Nations and the instruments that awaken its talent to create.


One such instrument could be the proposed Advisory Commission on Debt and Development. The Commission will come to life, not as a challenge to the creditor nations, but, indeed, as a tribute to them and as a move of collaboration by debtor nations in that new openness which creditors have begun to display.


The Brady plan sees forgiveness as essential to revitalizing adjustment and making us credit-worthy again. The Brady plan can jumpstart the stalled engines of development of debtor nations. The Brady plan is a beginning, and it must answer still other questions.


Is there no criterion, for instance, with which to judge the application of debt-reduction or relief, except that they should be pursued?


Must we wait until all the physical levels of production and productivity potentials are obliterated for the debt to be written off or forgiven?


Are not meaningful reductions possible only when there are new facilities that are not caught up in the inertia of the international bureaucracy or of strongly held philosophies and interests?


Otherwise, will the focus ever go beyond sub-Sahara? Should not the Government major actors of the plan be mobilizing their leverage and adjusting their financial regulations? Is it enough to lay out the bare bones, which lose their flavour in the broth of rhetoric? Should not the Commission be advising not only on how to persuade creditors to reduce debt but also on how to help debtors produce in order to pay debt?


There is, for instance, the generation of power - power produces goods; goods pay debts. The Commission could stimulate power-generation and raise the power capabilities of debtor countries. It could ask the questiom if rich countries have often been ready to underwrite slum clearances, cannot they launch a programme to underwrite power equipment on concessional terms for the development of a slum-cleared economy that in time, will develop the capacity to repay these concession al loans?


Let the world take note that the most outstanding success of the United Na tions is the United Nations itself.


The United Nations cap is full of feathers these days. There is a feather for putting Namibia irreversibly on the road to independence and to becoming the 160th Merrt>er of the United Nations. There is another feather for the Secretary-General's mediating a cease-fire and bringing fighting between Iran and Iraq to an end. There is a special feather: the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize for the United Nations peace-keeping forces.


There are still other feathers perhaps soon to be pinned on that cap--for United Nations campaigns on drug abuse, on the envircnment, and on terrorism. Can there be United Nations campaigns any more urgent than those against these universally recognized evils--drug abuse, abuse of the environment, terrorism? I submit that there can.


There is a conventional theological faith that every human being is born with original sin. There is a new theology, a theology of bondage, not liberation. Today, a human being is born not only with original sin but also with original debt. To quantify it, the third world now owes $1.3 trillion to creditors, so every child in that world is indebted up to $1,000 at the moment of birth. At an annual rate of interest of 10 per cent compounded, these human beings at the age of 21 will each owe $7,000, and if they marry at that age, husband and wife will begin their married life with a joint burden of over $14,000. Is not that a challenge worthy of 159 Members of the United Nations to take up?


Is not this campaign worthy of being launched now, now that the momentum of flexibility has stirred the ranks of the lenders?


Is not this the moment for the debtors to extend the hand of collaboration to the creditors, in a Commission, as the draft decision puts it, ""of eminent persons from the academic, political and financial sectors with knowledge and experience in international finance, trade and development, to develop innovative approaches and evolve specific proposals related to all types of debt in order to solve the debt prct>lem of developing countries in a manner consistent with their sustained growth and development""? (A/C.2/43/L.19, para. (a))


Let the Commission be the next feather in the United Nations cap. It will be a timely and elegant feather. A world of hungry debtors awaits its pinning in the United Nations cap."	1989-09-28
Raul S. Manglapus	UNGA 45	"On behalf of President Corazon Aquino and the Philippine delegation, I extend to you, Sir, and to the people and Government of the Republic of Malta, warmest felicitations on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. Your country reflects the rich Mediterranean blend of races and cultures and is therefore a microcosm of this Assembly, over which, with much deserved honour, you now preside.


Likewise, I should also like at this point to thank His Excellency Joseph B. Garba of Nigeria, the outgoing President of the General Assembly, and to congratulate him on work well done. There were many accomplishments during his term, not the least of which was the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly, which produced a significant consensus declaration on economic cooperation  so important in our quest for peace.


It is a year since we last met. Each year has its own character. We may call this year, 1990  the first is the United Nations Decade of International Law- the year of the reality  of freedom and the possibility of peace.


Some may think this characterisation naive in the context of the threat to peace is a critical area of the world. But the facts are there. 


The dream of a democratic Europe was once thought to be an absurd fantasy. For the only formula was thought to be the destruction by war of monolithic repression. And everyone knew it would have to be a nuclear war, which no one could win.


The idea of a totally democratic and therefore peaceful Latin America was once thought to be an empty illusion. There were too many odds against it. There was that theory, for instance, long ago proven bankrupt but still persistent, that democracy is an invention that suits only the developed West. And there was that super-Power policy, now, happily, ended, to encourage military dictators because it was easier to deal abroad with one than with a messy democratic regime.


The dream of a successful settlement in Cambodia and therefore of peace in South-East Asia was until only a month ago thought to be impossible. It seemed useless to unravel the intricate ideological and historical intertwinings in that unhappy land, or to find a graceful exit for the intervening Powers. Those Powers had fostered surrogates, and these surrogates had found their own domestic differences aggravated by policies escalated in distant foreign capitals.


Yet all these impossible dreams have in this concluding year found either actual, or at least inchoate, reality. The democratization of Eastern Europe, though not yet total, is real. For the first tim in history, all of the continental Latin America is democratic. The initial instruments for peace in Cambodia have been executed, and the intervening Powers are finding their graceful exits and divided nations are being reunited: today Germany; tomorrow, we hope, Korea.

It is the confluence of three historical factors that has produced this pioneering prospect for universal peace. The first is the rise of the power of the people of the world. One by one, these peoples have spoken, and this is their simple but non-negotiable demand: We want democracy, We want peace.

That was the message of our Philippine people-power revolution of 1986. And since then it has resonated through the public plazas of the world, toppling dictators and defenestrating repressive ideologies. It is never people who propose war; it is Governments. Therefore peace, universal peace, will be possible only when all the peoples of the world are free and when it is their voice that commands the structure of every Government.

There is a second factor in the success of the peace process. Efforts for peace have failed before, but where they have succeeded persistence has been a dominant ingredient. In Eastern Europe and in Latin America the people never gave up. In Cambodia the leaders never gave up. The Jakarta meetings and the Paris Conference, Ali Alatas and Roland Dumas never gave up. The permanent members of the Security Council never gave up.

There is that third factor. It is the United Nations. This perseverance of the United Nations, in the language of the Secretary-Generals report of September 1990, has produced peace and democracy in Namibia a quarter of a century after the General Assembly resolution and a dozen years after the Security Council action.

We sense the coming death of apartheid in the wake of peaceful United Nations initiatives. We see the rise of the new democracy in Nicaragua; a cease-fire in democratic El Salvador; a political solution in democratic Guatemala; a referendum in Western Sahara; the promotion of a consensus among guarantor Powers in Afghanistan.

The inventory of the Secretary-Generals successes is long indeed. There is only one sombre cloud in the world and it hangs over that region we have come to call the Middle East.

Perhaps the first step towards understanding that region is to give proper recognition to its objective geographic position. The region called the Far East once possessed only a relative colonial Euro-centric identity until it came into its own as East Asia. Why Middle East? Middle between what? The term was coined only in 1902 by a Western expansionist. The region is West Asia and North Africa and it is time to recognize them as objective absolutes.

The people of West Asia and North Africa must be no different from those of Eastern Europe and Latin America in their human aspirations. Their demands, if self-articulated, would be irrevocable: freedom and peace.

Last week, President Franois Mitterrand spoke to this Assembly on guarantees for the democratic expression of the Kuwaiti people's will. Why, indeed, should the rhetoric of national responses to the crisis in that region be devoid of any mention of those values while the rest of the world is awash with the tidal wave of democracy and peace?

We hear of violations of borders, of threats to territorial integrity, of mass displacement of human beings, of disruption of the oil market, of devastation of economies and of destruction of lives. These are grave acts and the Philippines has from their inception joined the United Nations in their condemnation.

We have accepted the Security Council resolutions and implemented them, even as we have joined other Asian Governments in appreciating the positive attitude of the Iraqi Government towards the evacuation of our workers, and even as we appreciate the assistance to our evacuees by Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates, by Spain, Japan, New Zealand and by the United Nations agencies, particularly the International Organisation for Migration and the United Nations Disaster Relief Organisation, which have been doing their work with the assistance of the European Community and the United States of America.

The United Nations and with it the significant Powers of the world are joined in confronting this threat and in searching for a formula for peace.

But perhaps we should be hearing more suggestions that this crisis  with its Chinese character combination of danger and opportunity  might be an occasion, best of our new worlds democracy, freedom and peace for all.

There is a rallying call for all to bring peace to West Asia. The call is for all and why not? It is the concern of all when one nation invades another, when hundreds of thousands of workers are displaced, when fuel costs bring poor economies to their knees.

But many of us are already prostrate on our knees and it is not just the West Asian crisis that has brought us down to this abject position. Yet again we have come to this Assembly for relief. I do not speak for a country in arrears when I make this plea on behalf of all the debtor nations of the world. The Philippine debt is inherited from a dictator. But it is an inherited obligation and we honour it. The Philippines is a faithful payer of principal and interest. We indulge in no radical posturing. We impose on ourselves no unilateral moratoriums.

To service our debt our country must divert over 40 per cent of our annual budget for payments on our debt and almost a third of this is for foreign debt service. Since 1986 we have sent out annually $1.7 billion more than we receive. How shall we resolve debt? It is valuable to reschedule debt. But it is even more precious and human to forgive debt.

The makers of policy must agree to resolve the question: Who is entitled to debt relief and debt forgiveness? Is it possible to fix standards rather than markets? They must agree to alternative adjustment programmes to promote growth that will suit both planned and free economies.

The Philippines profoundly appreciates the relief it is receiving through the operations of the Brady Plan, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). But the makers of policy must develop new modes to carry out global solutions, for the present mechanisms are not equipped for such a momentous mission.

The IMF traditionally approaches short-term problems, like balance of payments, with an average span of 18 months. But the structural and financial horizons of transnational debt can span a generation.

The World Bank has primarily concerned itself with financing projects and, more recently, with programmes. Yet it is only in the context of an aggregate panorama that the financial obligations of nations can be amply appreciated.

It is now almost a decade that the debt crisis has been thundering across our planet. Its assault is overwhelming us because our defences are isolated and our strategies fragmented. We propose a global counter-attack by forces that will transcend geography and ideology.

If the whole world can be summoned to confront the invaders in West Asia, why may we not summon this same world to confront that invader from the nether world of international finance, that monster created by debtor and creditor alike? Are we not entitled to marshal the cerebral talents of nations for this confrontation?

At Versailles, in 1919, the victorious allies of the First World War refused to condone the enervating obligations of the defeated Germans and Germany went to the radical right for a solution. That solution produced the Second World War.

The Allies, again victorious in 1945, remembered Versailles. At London, they forgave 70 per cent of the German interest payments. At that time the principal on that debt amounted to $1.5 billion or roughly $8 billion in todays terms.

The same bold visionary leadership that condemned that debt also conceived the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The allies condoned 70 per cent of the interest payments of a defeated nation whose aggressiveness had already devastated half of Europe and shaken the world. In victory and in order to nip at conception another monstrous aggression, the allies forgave debt. In victory and for peace, anything was possible.

Again, last week President Mitterrand said verbatim, that if Iraq were to withdraw from Kuwait, everything might become possible. May we not claim the same possibility for countries guilty of no devastation and no invasion, guilty only at most of some improvidence in borrowings and in fiscal management? Did President Mitterrand mean to include the condonation of their debt as one of the possibles?

Before victory and in search of peace, before devastation even takes place, is it possible to be human and to speak of a tabula rasa, to give the world a fresh beginning? Only last Sunday we filled this historic Assembly Hall with Heads of State, Heads of Government and the children of the world. Children read in many tongues from the ringing Declaration of the Summit of the Child.

There was something that was not declared about the child of today which I now respectfully submit once more to the Assembly. The third world now owes $1.3 trillion. Therefore every child in that world is born not only, as some theologies profess, with original sin but also with original debt, up to $11,000 at the moment of birth, which at 10 per cent compounded interest reaches $77,000 at age 21. In this glorious year of the child, is it not time to redeem the original debt of that child?

The Philippines will never renege on its obligations, but neither will it cease to live up to its obligation to plead for universal justice."	1990-10-12
Raul S. Manglapus	UNGA 46	"We meet today as we end a year that began with a crisis. The United Nations confronted that crisis and resolved it. Standing tall in the midst of that crisis, threatened but undaunted, welcoming assistance but marching out first, in the vanguard of its own defence and the redemption of its neighbours, was a proud nation called Saudi Arabia. It is fitting that the Assembly should now be presided over by a man from that nation, with an outstanding record of leadership in diplomatic engagements for his country, for his race, for his region and for the world. With Mr. Samir S. Shihabi as our President, we face a historic and most productive session.

We had one such session last year, when Mr. Guido de Marco of the Republic of Malta presided over the Assembly and led us to significant, indelible accomplishments towards the restructuring and reform of the United Nations. We congratulate Mr. de Marco as he yields the presidency to Mr. Shihabi.

I am here to speak for my country, but permit me to note that while I speak for no other country I do stand here proud of our membership in, and this year of our being Chairman of, the Standing Committee of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), to which the Philippines is bound in ever-developing solidarity with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.

The history of the Organization has been marked with celebrations. We are, for instance, at the moment in the middle of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, and also the World Decade for Cultural Development. We have already celebrated international years for the women and the children of the world. Since 1973 there have been on record 21 such United Nations salutes.These celebrations establish the character of the United Nations  and sculpt the milestones of the performance of humankind in this demi-century.

I submit that our Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, from 1973 to 1983, furnished ideological fuel for the popular movement in South Africa that extracted this year an official decision, though not yet adequately implemented, to dismantle apartheid. We solemnly marked the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in that year of 1988 during which there began the process for the final solution of the Cambodian crisis. That historic congruence in time, I submit, reminded the negotiators that the process, if it was to be successful, could only culminate in the universal human right of free democratic elections. That right, happily for history, is about to be implemented in Cambodia. We must felicitate the South Africans and the Cambodians on these two human triumphs which are part of an ennobling, victorious, current human momentum that we have so far failed to celebrate. It is the mounting momentum of the people and it has been in progress for a quarter of a century. People have been crushed before, and their momentum has been many times aborted. But there is no substitute for the people, as Alexander Dub?ek told me in Prague last year. The people and time are unconquerable allies.

So it began, predictably enough, in Greece, where in four days of November 1973 the people, initially quelled by the army, succeeded in replacing dictatorship with democracy. The power of the people swept southern Europe, leaped to Latin America, Asia, eastern Europe and now southern Africa. Not only heroic individuals but people, masses of people, are changing the face of the Earth. The Philippines could claim a modest share in the propulsion of this momentum of the people. A New York Times editorial has characterized scenes of Muscovites during the recent coup as reminiscent of Manilas people-power revolt.

The power of the people is enshrined in the Philippine 1987 Constitution not only in general preambular terms but in operative provisions that have made us a direct, as well as a representative, democracy. One of the drafters of that document put it this way:

The fact that the people elect representatives is not an act of complete trust in those representatives; the people retain the right to review their decisions.

Our direct democracy is not only on the village level: it is national.

Direct democracy, says one of our Senators, is superior to representative democracy.

At this very moment the people of the Philippines are gathering signatures for a national referendum on the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Security which we have signed with the United States of America and which has been rejected by the Philippine Senate. In our direct democracy, we respect our Senate but we also respect our people. Senatus cum populo: the Senate and the people must rule together.

Is there a relevance in this to the mission of the United Nations? Ours has become a unipolar world. There are misgivings about this new global condition. It is asked, now that the bipolar balance is gone: what is to restrain the solitary super-Power from overstating its duties as keeper of the new world order? The ultimate restraint on that super-Power is its very system, in which the people are supreme.

It was the people in America that pulled this country from a war in South-East Asia which they perceived to be irrelevant. It was the same people that cheered America to a precision victory in a Gulf war that they acclaimed as inevitable. It is the same people that are keeping America sober in its triumphal hour. Indeed, constitutional democracy is not a synonym for peace, nor is it a hard-bound warranty against international violence. But where can we find a more productive forum for peace? Where can we find a more fertile context for transparency and restraint?

Today the once theoretical paper dreams of constitutional accessibility and openness have become hard reality. Democratic constitutions have found a new ally: technology. The same laboratories that are enhancing the science of discriminate demolition have already made it possible for humankind to be the instant witness to tragedies of all kinds and in all places. Those scenes can horrify people into demanding openness from their leaders, but the people must be free to make the demands. Electronic transparency could lead to moral, official and diplomatic transparency, and that process could mobilize the restraining forces in society.

We must agree with another recent remarkable editorial of The New York Times which warns that outsiders should not redesign the internal polity of nations. But it adds that there is every reason to proclaim and promote democratic values. The counsel was directed to America. But shall we leave it to America alone to shepherd the values of the world? Can we not find other proclaimers and promoters of democratic values? How about the United Nations?

It is wrong to say that the United Nations is only the theatre of States, the agora of international ideas, the conciliator of multilateral contradictions; for it is more than those categories, however unique, historic and invaluable they may be. The United Nations, I submit, is above all, indeed, a proclaimer and promoter of values  and let us not evade the words at this juncture  the United Nations is a proclaimer and promoter of democratic values.

What else is General Assembly resolution 217 A (III) of 10 December 1948, what else is this Universal Declaration of Human Rights, what else is this ringing document, but the inventory of constitutional democracy? It is all there: the right to life, liberty, speech, property, movement, assembly, social services, non-discrimination, participation, down to the specific of periodic and genuine elections  all essential and standard items in national bills of rights. The General Assembly proclaims these rights as a common standard for all peoples and all nations and enjoins every individual and every organ of society to promote them.

The United Nations proclaims and promotes democracy and along with it, transparency and restraint. Article 19 gives everyone the right to seek, receive and impart information and Article 21 identifies the basis of government authority  the will of the people, which is also the ultimate restrainer of official abuse.

Thirteen years before the Declaration of Human Rights, there was already an auspicious portent for it in the Charter that gave life to the United Nations in 1945. The Charter opened its preamble with a reaffirmation of faith in fundamental human rights and, at the first opportunity, in Article 73 b, in dealing with States in gestation, enjoined the United Nations to develop free political institutions in the lands under its trust.

Indeed, in trust territories there is always the happy, challenging prospect of fresh beginnings. But so are these post-cold-war times a challenge to fresh beginnings.

Many factors spelled the end of the cold war. But we would be mocking history if we did not recognize that the final verdict that tumbled the walls was rendered by a world of peoples  peoples wishing to end the shackling of their minds, their souls, their political institutions and their economies. The cooling winds of liberalization blew themselves into a gale of democracy which even now is still huffing and puffing at the residual ramparts of involuntary servitude

If the United Nations intends to design a global strategy for peace that will not only dwell on the surface of the issue  or even just below it  but will strike at its roots, it must return to its own roots, recall its resonant declarations and resensitize itself to its compliment to the rights of human beings.

""Nations are the vital constituents of this Organization and, of course, the Organization must never violate the sovereignty of those nations. But I have shown, I hope, that these very nations, united, have not abdicated, but refurbished their own sovereignty by urging themselves and all peoples . . . every individual and every organ of society (General Assembly resolution 217 A (III), seventh preambular paragraph) to promote those values that are nothing if not the very stuff of constitutional democracy.


Let the United Nations leadership ensure that every assembly in the United Nations, every council, every court, every organ, shall to-immerse itself in this original mission.

There is a responsive, eager world awaiting this leadership. Large land masses have opened themselves to the world  in Eastern Europe, in Africa, in Asia. Our great neighbour, the People's Republic of China, has declared its determination to implement the policies of reform and opening to the outside world. And this very United Nations has stretched its arms open in welcome to even more of the gallant peoples of the world.


The Philippines extends a special welcome to our Pacific neighbours to the East  the Republic of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. We salute also our two neighbours to the North  the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  whose brotherly simultaneous ingress into our company may soon produce the resurrected unity of a single great nation.


We salute those three brave nations of the Baltic Sea  Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia  who are back at last in their rightful place in the community of nations.

And one last salute to Prince Norodom Sihanouk, that great Asian  noble by blood and by principle  who now leads the Cambodian delegation to this assembly of nations.""


""All of these are triumphs of the people. Since 1973 the people of the world have been speaking and they have been winning. In the last two years the General Assembly has passed resolutions on human development proclaiming that human beings are the goal  not simply the means  of development. Gross national product statistics are meaningless if they answer only the questions of how well-fed, how well-housed, how well-clothed the people are. The statistics of our computerized bureaus must also respond to the demanding enquiry: how free are these people?


The record of the United Nations must contain in detail the ongoing story of the ascent to dignity and freedom of humanity en masse.


Let the nations of the world applaud the people of the world. For this, indeed, is the quarter century of the people."	1991-10-04
Roberto R. Romulo	UNGA 47	"It is with special pleasure that the Government and the people of the Philippines extend to you, Sir, their warm felicitations on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. You were one of the most prominent and vigorous advocates of freedom and democracy in your country. We in the Philippines watched your struggle with interest and sympathy, and we joined the rest of the world in applauding the triumph of that struggle as the triumph of us all. That triumph led to your elevation to the high office you now hold in your country and, now, to your election as President of the General Assembly. Your election, therefore, is a source of special satisfaction for us.


At the same time, we congratulate your predecessor. His Excellency Ambassador Samir S. Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for his excellent leadership in presiding over the Assembly at its forty-sixth session.


My delegation also warmly welcomes Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. He brings to his arduous and exalted mission decades of experience in and deep insight into the relations among nations and the nature and work of the United Nations. In less than a year in office, Mr. Boutros-Ghali has demonstrated not only an unflinching devotion to the work of our Organization but also a keen sense of the direction it must take in dealing with the great international issues of our time.


Permit me at this point to express the heartfelt appreciation and gratitude of the Philippine Government and of the Filipino people for the generous assistance extended by the members of the world community and international organizations to the hundreds of thousands of victims of floods and mud flows from Mt. Pinatubo, whose fury has been described by scientists as the volcanic eruption of the century. Their dire prediction is that Mt. Pinatubos mud flows, which have already buried towns and villages and turned the once green fields of Central Luzon into a grey and desolate landscape, will continue its destruction for several more years. As we embark on large-scale relief and rehabilitation efforts in the affected areas, my Government would like once more to appeal for assistance from the members of the international community and organizations even as we thank them for the help already extended since Mt. Pinatubo erupted in June 1991.


We hold this session of the General Assembly at a moment in history that has seen the wave of democracy and national freedom sweep the world with astounding and unprecedented rapidity. This is manifested by, among others, the roster of new countries admitted to the United Nations this year  nations newly emerged from the confining and oppressive darkness of totalitarian imperialism: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, Slovenia, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. This list of new States, new Members of the United Nations, reads like a roll of honour in the annals of freedom in our era. We welcome them, as we also do San Marino, to these halls.


We Filipinos take pride in having been early in the ranks of democracys march in recent history. In 1986, through the exercise of people power, we restored the institutions of democracy in our country. This democratic restoration found both fulfillment and renewed strength in the national elections our people conducted five months ago and in the peaceful transfer of power that resulted from the supreme exercise of the democratic process.


The very fact of that peaceful transfer of power through free elections has affirmed, for all to see, the political stability of our land and, no doubt, contributed to the climate of peace and stability in our region.


In pursuance of national stability and peace, our new leadership, under President Fidel V. Ramos, has embarked on a policy and mission of reconciliation among our people, closing divisions, healing wounds and reaching out to all. Among the measures we have taken is the granting of amnesty to those disaffected groups which had taken the path of rebellion of whatever ideological or religious persuasion they might be, to whatever organizational or ethnic affiliation they might belong.


Elected under the banner of people empowerment, our new leadership has chosen, through its policies, to ride the crest of the wave of economic liberalization that has inexorably rolled across the world and has, in so many nations, improved so many lives in so short a time. We have chosen this path for the same reason others have done  because we believe that it is the best road to sustained economic growth and a better life for our people.


Our new leadership, immediately upon assuming office, committed itself unequivocally to the liberalization of our trading regime and of the rules governing investments in our country. We have removed virtually all foreign-exchange controls, thus facilitating the international movement of currency. The privatization of key public industries proceeds apace. Consistent with the new primacy of commerce and economics in relations between nations, we have placed trade and economic relations at the top of our diplomatic priorities.


Only a few weeks ago, in Jakarta, the capital city of our Indonesian neighbour, we joined the Non-Aligned Movement, in which the Philippines had been an observer for many years. Far from being rendered irrelevant by the end of the cold war, the Non-Aligned Movement, we found, was larger, stronger and even more relevant than ever before. Many of the old divisions in the Movement had closed, and a new cohesion had been found. Moreover, the Movement had turned more of its attention to problems of trade, finance, technology and all those other things that make up economic relations between nations.


The end of the cold war may have greatly diminished the likelihood of worldwide conflict and global cataclysm, but it has given rise to new challenges that are just as threatening for the peoples of many nations and regions, even as many of the old issues remain unresolved.


The weight of their external debt continues to crush the economies of many developing countries, including those countries, like the Philippines, which have made strenuous efforts to pay their debts religiously. Surely, with some imagination and creativity, and a modicum of good will and enlightened self-interest, the nations of the world can, together, arrive at some solution that would allow the debtor countries to develop and get out from under the crushing burden of their debt. At the very least, the debtor countries should be given access to their actual and potential markets without any artificial restrictions, to allow them to develop their economies and improve the lives of their peoples while they continue to service their debts from meagre resources.


More and more of the worlds nations have adhered ever more strongly to the proposition that economic liberalization is vital to the improvement of industrial productivity and the generation of economic growth. And yet, most ironically, protectionist barriers continue to rise and to hamper the flow of goods and services. The worlds peoples call upon the international community, in particular upon the developed countries, to lay aside narrow self-interest and push forward the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations to a speedy and successful conclusion.


The formation of trading blocs in some areas has aroused the apprehension of countries outside those blocs with respect to their potential for artificially diverting trade and investment, diversions damaging to the efficiency of the global economic system. We in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) have committed ourselves to the formation of an ASEAN free trade area that would facilitate trade among ourselves. But we are determined to keep ourselves open to world trade, on which our economies depend so much.


Each country has an inalienable right to development. And the United Nations has a paramount role in seeing to it that it is realized. The ongoing restructuring and revitalization process in the economic and social fields should therefore be geared towards the effective discharge of this role by the United Nations system.


The continuing scourge of poverty, the rapid increase in population, the uneven rate of economic growth among countries and the asymmetry in the economic and social structures of nations, together with the dazzling advances in transportation and communication, have given rise to a new phenomenon of our times: the massive migration of labour. As one of the largest sources of this migration, the Philippines is convinced that it is now time for the international community to deal with this phenomenon no longer in haphazard and isolated ways, but on a planned and strategic basis and on an international scale.


In so doing, we would do well to heed the appeal of the Secretary-General to accord deeper understanding and respect to the rights and needs of the more vulnerable groups of society. A substantial part of the migration of labour is the thousands of young women from many developing countries who venture forth to more affluent countries in search of a better life for themselves and their families, only to fall victim to unspeakable abuse, in many cases to violence, sometimes ending in death, simply because they are women. Roaming the streets of the world are 145 million children  homeless, hungry, neglected, in most cases victims of abuse and mistreatment by adults. Thousands of the disabled and the ageing, particularly in the developing countries, are cast away, stripped of their dignity, from the mainstream of society.


The untrammelled population growth in many regions, the profligate use of the Earths resources and the pollution of the land, water and air have severely damaged the Earths life-sustaining ecology in many places, threatening the livelihoods of farmers and fishermen and the health of everyone. It was therefore with a keen sense of hope and high expectations that the Philippines participated in the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro last June. At that Conference, the collective will of the international community was marshalled at the highest level of leadership on behalf of the sustainable development of our Earth and its resources. The Philippines applauds its considerable achievements and remains committed to its goals and ideals, as embodied in Agenda 21, the implementation of which requires adequate new and additional financial resources.


To carry out on a national scale the objectives set forth in Agenda 21, my President has created the Philippine Council for Sustainable Development, which counts non-governmental organizations and, particularly, the youth among its members. I am also pleased to announce that, in observance of the International Year for the Worlds Indigenous People, the Philippines will host in April next year a Global Youth Earth Summit or Global YES in cooperation with the United Nations Environment Programmes Global Youth Forum and with the full endorsement and support of the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and the International Labour Organisation. I appeal to the world to support this undertaking.


The cold wars end has lifted a great pall of global threat from over the Earth and closed a fundamental division in the international community. It has thus opened new vistas of hope for peace and global security, directly leading to major advances in some of the worlds hitherto intractable conflicts: Afghanistan, Cambodia, the Middle East, Central America, South Africa. Nevertheless, intra-regional and intra-national conflicts continue to ravage peoples lives and homes.


The end of super-Power confrontation and the dissolution of empires and blocs have freed nations and dismantled tyrannies. They have also unleashed age-old hostilities between antagonistic groups and released them to erupt in tragic violence. These conflicts, new and old, have taken various forms and dimensions.


In the Middle East, movement in the peace process has given rise to new, albeit modest, hopes. However, hope must be tempered still, as the basic cause of conflict  the denial of a homeland and sovereignty to the Palestinian people  remains unresolved.


In South Africa, the institutions of apartheid have been dismantled, a hopeful development that can be attributed in no small measure to the resolute and patient efforts of the United Nations and the international community. We are heartened that the stalled negotiations on the future of that country may finally get back on track with the expected resumption of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa. In Somalia, intertribal warfare conspires with the cruelties of nature to inflict upon the people of that unhappy land death by violence or starvation. The people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, specifically its Muslim population, are subjected to the barbarity of ethnic cleansing and the horrors of fratricidal war while the international community helplessly looks on. Similar forms, if not similar degrees, of ethnic violence have erupted in some places in the former Soviet Union.


In our own region of South-East Asia, in Cambodia, a peace agreement painstakingly worked out by the United Nations, the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), other interested Governments and the Cambodian factions themselves has provided for and led to the mounting of the largest peace-keeping operation of the United Nations and the assumption of one of its gravest responsibilities, the United Nations Transitional Authority for Cambodia, to which the Philippines has contributed a contingent of policemen and naval observers. However, one of the factions has, of late, chosen not to participate further in the peace process until its conditions, some of which go beyond the terms of the Paris Peace Agreement, are met. It is now the responsibility of the international community to ensure that the fabric of imminent peace does not unravel and to place the peace process back on track.


Conflicting claims in the South China Sea have given rise to acute concern among the countries involved and other States with interests in the area. Last July the Foreign Ministers of ASEAN issued in Manila the ASEAN Declaration on the South China Sea, calling on all claimants to settle their disputes peacefully, pledging to embark on cooperative endeavours in the area and inviting all parties concerned to subscribe to the Declaration. Dialogues have been taking place in the region involving officials and academicians from the claimant States and other interested parties. It is our hope that these dialogues will help to avert misunderstanding and conflict and eventually lead to the day when this vast, vital and strategic portion of the sea can be transformed from an area of incipient tension into a region of enduring peace and cooperation. All these fall squarely under the purposes and principles of the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation in South-East Asia, which the signatories, including the Philippines, are requesting the General Assembly to endorse at this session.


Thus, even as the world welcomes the cold wars end and the march of freedom and democracy across the earth, in the relations among nations old wounds fester, break out and recur and new ones are opened. And yet hopes run higher than they have ever done since the last great war. These hopes are focused especially on the new possibilities for the United Nations in its mission of preventing war, making peace, keeping the peace and building for peace. In this new era of opportunity it is both possible and imperative for the United Nations to discharge the role envisioned for it by the Charter as the primary keeper of peace and security in the world.

It is therefore extremely fitting that in his first report on the work of the Organization our new Secretary-General dwells almost exclusively on this role of the United Nations and the opportunities opened for it by the historic changes of recent times.


The Philippines welcomes the Secretary-Generals report, An Agenda for Peace: Preventive Diplomacy, Peacemaking and Peace-Keeping, and is studying it with great attention. We commend it to the world for serious consideration, for it seeks to bring the United Nations back to its roots as an organization with an effective capacity to make peace and keep the peace.

The report is filled with wise, timely and practical prescriptions, and I should like to single out a few.


We support the Secretary-Generals call for an enlarged and more effective role for the International Court of Justice. We join the Secretary-General in reaffirming the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes, as approved by the General Assembly. We endorse his recognition of the need to relieve the economic difficulties of States that are affected by sanctions imposed on another State under Article 41 of the Charter.


We commend for especially close consideration the Secretary-Generals bold proposals for giving life to Chapter VII of the Charter, particularly Article 42, which authorizes the Security Council to take military action to maintain or restore international peace and security, and Article 43, which mandates Members of the United Nations to place armed forces and facilities on call for this purpose.


Granting the United Nations increased power and greater authority for peace-keeping and enforcement action would gain stronger support from the international community if the Security Council could function with a greater degree of democracy than heretofore. Why, for example, should a region with approximately 15 per cent of the worlds population and 23 per cent of the total membership of the United Nations have 40 per cent representation in the Security Council this year, with three having the power of veto?


Clearly, that is a legitimate question. However, the composition of the Security Council is but one of the provisions in the Charter that could stand improvement. My delegation appreciates current efforts to restructure and revitalize the economic and social sectors of the United Nations and to reform both the General Assembly and the Secretariat. We note, however, that such efforts are often limited by a hesitation to review the United Nations Charter itself.

Addressing the work of the Special Committee on the Charter and the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization during the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly, the then Philippine Foreign Minister, 


General Carlos P. Romulo, said:


At no time in history has it been more clear that the many and closely interrelated global problems that beset us will not yield to piecemeal and national solutions. The paramount importance of the United Nations as the capstone of human society has been reaffirmed with great force by the momentous events even of this single year. The design of a new world economic order, the mobilizing of world agriculture, a global approach to population problems, the equitable redistribution of world economic resources, the achievement of disarmament and peace  all require an ever more effective and more efficient world Organization.


For these reasons, it is more than ever appropriate that we are continuing our consideration of the improvement of the United Nations itself. The centrality of the United Nations is obvious and inescapable. The increasing value of the United Nations is undoubted. But its rate of adaptation to rapidly moving world affairs is doubted; its adequacy to perform the functions thrust upon it by its Members, and simply by the urgent course of world history, is doubted.


When we began this discussion in 1970, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of our world Organization, the effort seemed pertinent enough. But now, as we continue, the accelerating pace of change in the world has already caught up with us and threatens to pass us by. The mechanisms of the United Nations are increasingly creaky and primitive in light of the task of plenary management that the Organization is increasingly called upon to assume. While the prescience of the founders was remarkable, and they succeeded in designing a flexible and adaptable Organization with a Charter of enduring worth, at  the same time it was wholly impossible for them to anticipate the speed with which events would carry us into the interdependent global age and the requirements that would be placed on our world body.


General Romulo, who happened to be my father and one of the founders of the United Nations, made these remarks in 1974. He might as well be making them today. I do not wish to state the obvious, but I know that my fathers message rings loud and clear in this Hall. Let us now proceed to rectify the omissions of the past.


Towards this end, the Philippine delegation submits that the time has come for the United Nations to avail itself of the provisions of Article 109 regarding the convening of a General Conference to review the Charter. My delegation will consult with like-minded Members in the coming year with a view to definitively addressing this proposal, specifically through a resolution calling for such a review conference, which, according to the Charter itself, should have been placed on the agenda of the General Assembly 10 years after its adoption in 1945.


We are only three years shy of the fiftieth anniversary of our Organization. Its celebration, we believe, would be further enhanced by the adoption and implementation of such a resolution. Through it, we hope to contribute to the noble work of making the United Nations a truly effective instrument, as the signatories envisioned it to be, for saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war and for promoting social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. The confluence of historic events in our time presents us with a unique opportunity to fulfil the mandate from our founders. Let us prove ourselves worthy of their trust."	1992-10-06
Roberto R. Romulo	UNGA 48	"I am most pleased to convey to Ambassador Insanally my congratulations and those of my delegation on his election as President of General Assembly at this session. At the same time, I wish to express our sincere appreciation to Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria for guiding with skill and dedication the work of the Assembly at its previous session.


Let me pay a tribute to our Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the vision and the energy he has devoted to the leadership of our Organization at a difficult but exhilarating moment in history.


Allow me to express at this point the deep sympathies of my delegation for the people of India in connection with the tragedy visited upon them by the earthquake that devastated parts of the state of Maharashtra.


The President is presiding over the work of the Assembly in a world that continues its amazing political transformation. Since we met in this same Hall last year, a period that is but the twinkling of an eye in the long history of mankind, the worlds political landscape has been further and radically transformed. That transformation is, above all, reflected in and exemplified by two of the major preoccupations that have exercised the Assembly and the international community for decades - namely, the situation in South Africa and the problem of Palestine.


The abhorrent system of apartheid, long the evil foundation of the South African State, has finally crumbled because of the unremitting efforts of the people of South Africa and of the international community, not least of the United Nations. In its place, multiracial negotiations - in themselves an amazing phenomenon in that country - have led to a specific programme with a precise timetable for the conversion of South Africa, in the words recently uttered in this Hall by that authentic leader of the South African people, Nelson Mandela, ""into a united, democratic, non-racial and non-sexist country"".


The whole situation in the Middle East, too, has been transformed, a transformation symbolized by a single handshake in Washington. That historic gesture resulted from complex combinations of circumstances and developments and presages further arduous negotiations and determined efforts by the Israeli and Palestinian peoples and their neighbours. But there is now, more than ever before, reason to trust that in that long-afflicted part of the world the politics of intolerance, hatred and despair is being replaced by the politics of accommodation, enlightenment, pragmatism and hope.


Thus, the international communitys political agenda, and the substance and content, if not the item-titles, of the Assemblys agenda, have radically changed. The global economy is being transformed no less radically. Everywhere, obsolete obstacles to trade are coming down, if not yet globally, then within the various regions of the world. To be sure, economic barriers continue to be propped up by atavistic hands that seek to reverse the tide and hold back the march of global economic progress. The most obvious victim of these rearguard actions is the Uruguay Round, which, after years of frustrating negotiations and painstaking bargaining, has yet to come to a conclusion. The ultimate victims are the global economy and the livelihoods and standards of living of the worlds peoples. Here, the accusing finger of history points at certain developed countries, with their short-sighted subsidies and protectionist devices. Nevertheless, the trend towards trade and economic liberalization gathers momentum. More and more nations recognize that that trend can be reversed only at the peril of the well-being of the worlds peoples.


Our region of South-East Asia has been a vital part of the global political and economic transformation. The conflict in Cambodia and the agony of the Cambodian people long preoccupied this Assembly as well as the Security Council. Going beyond the expectations of so many, the Cambodian people have made their historic decision for peace and reconciliation. We now call upon the international community to extend its support to the Cambodian people and their new Government so that they will find surcease not only from war, but also from poverty and want, and so that they will find not only peace, but a life of dignity and freedom.


The Declaration by the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) on the South China Sea, which was issued in Manila last year, has received the strong endorsement of the United Nations and of individual Governments, and we in South-East Asia have continued our measured effort to build a regime of peace, cooperation and mutual confidence in that disputed area.


Earlier this year we in ASEAN, joined by the other nations of East Asia, including Viet Nam and Laos, and by others with interests in the region, agreed upon an ASEAN Regional Forum in which questions of regional security can be periodically examined and discussed together. In East Asia, the rapid advance of economic liberalization has propelled the economies of the region to achieve some of the highest growth rates in the world. The commitment to the free market has found its most forceful expression in the decision of ASEANs leaders to establish an ASEAN Free Trade Area through the steady reduction and eventual elimination of trade barriers within ASEAN.


Happily, the dawning of a new era of peace and the promise of prosperity in our region have found a bright reflection in my country. President Ramos policy of national unity and reconciliation has replaced the politics of division. Dissident elements have been drawn back into the fold of society. Peace talks with the remaining disaffected groups are being held. Amnesty has been offered to all.


The economics of selfishness and greed is being replaced with reforms to secure economic fairness and social justice. The Philippine economy is ruled no longer by the tyranny of excessive regulation or of corporate monopoly but by the invigorating regime of market forces and free competition.Global competitiveness, in place of political contention, is now the watchword throughout the land. All this is being carried out with the most meticulous respect for human rights in accordance with the national consensus and the deepest convictions of our people. It is being achieved within the framework of our democratic institutions. For we are convinced that there is no substitute for respect for human rights and democracy in the achievement of long-term stability and progress, as well as in the assurance of human dignity and the fulfilment of human aspirations.


The new situation in the world gives us new hope and a brighter promise. But grave dangers and tragic situations remain. Old scourges continue to torment the human family; new agonies confront it.


Religious intolerance and the rise of nationalist ambitions have supplanted ideological fanaticism as the fuel for the fires of conflict that now burn in too many places in the world. The collapse of empires has let loose the savage impulse to settle historical scores, redress ancient ethnic grievances, and set right real or imagined injustices over national borders, the treatment of minorities, or the control of resources.


The tragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of the worst and most dangerous of these barbarities. Despite - in certain cases, because of - the onset of a climate of peace, trafficking in the weapons of war sometimes continues unabated, dissipating resources, endangering people, imperilling the peace. The Philippines steadfastly supports measures to promote greater transparency in arms transfers and military expenditures, including the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms.


The Philippines urges the nuclear-weapon States, in the strongest terms, to restore the recently broken moratorium on all nuclear testing, and hopes that the international community will decide, through a comprehensive test-ban treaty, to cease for ever the testing of nuclear devices, which so gravely threaten the very existence of the human family. The Philippines favours the extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and calls upon all to abide strictly by its provisions, including the safeguards agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency.


At the same time, we urge the nuclear-weapon States to fulfil their own obligations under the Treaty and further reduce their stocks of such weapons until they are no more. Amid the rising tide of economic liberalization, the siren song of protectionism continues to entice nations with its fraudulent promise. Legitimate concerns over health, food safety, the environment, workers welfare, and even human rights, including the rights of indigenous peoples - and now ""social dumping"" - are being invoked to clothe in various guises policies of naked protectionism. Decisions on global finance continue to be made by a few, with the rest of the world standing by even though it is vitally affected. The burden of foreign debt continues to be a millstone round the necks of many developing countries, and the problem is often aggravated by decisions on interest rates and exchange rates in which those countries have no voice.


The Philippines continues faithfully to fulfil its external financial obligations, regardless of the extent to which that policy holds back our economic growth, constitutes a burden on our people, and imposes a heavy domestic political cost on our leaders. But we wonder whether the world has tried hard enough to devise creative solutions to this economic plague upon the developing countries. After all, some nations have been favoured with decisive - even radical - measures to alleviate their foreign debt, such measures having become politically useful to the creditor countries. The ravages that the profligacy of man has wrought upon the Earths delicate environment continue to endanger our fragile planet and many nations. The Philippines has kept faith with the commitments made by us all at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development because of its conviction that development cannot be sustained if the worlds - and the countrys - natural riches and the balance between them are destroyed.


No less destructive is the accelerating increase in the illicit trafficking in drugs, which destroys the lives of our people in the vigour of their youth. It gives rise to lawlessness and crime. It knows no national boundaries. We therefore appeal for the full and effective implementation of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme and the Global Programme of Action. In situations of conflict, women, as well as children, become the most tragic victims by virtue of their inherent vulnerability. The systematic rape and murder of women and girls in Bosnia and Herzegovina is only the most outrageous instance of this abhorrent reality.


Similarly, in situations of extreme poverty, women - particularly migrant workers - are the most vulnerable to abuse. Detached from the family, away from their homeland, often living in their employers home, unprotected by the country where they work, women migrant workers are especially susceptible to maltreatment. The abuses to which they are exposed, and often subjected, are a veritable litany of woe - denial of their rightful wages, excessive deductions by their employment agencies, intolerably long working hours, insufficient food, lack of medical care, the absence of any avenue for the redress of their grievances, physical attack, rape and other forms of sexual abuse.


We call upon the Assembly to keep among the areas of its concern the condition of women, who make up half of the world - in particular, the migrant workers among them. And we call upon the Governments concerned to enact laws and other measures for the protection of these migrant workers. We ask these Governments to cease the callous treatment of migrant workers as commodities that are subject only to the law of supply and demand.


These scourges of mankind - mass poverty, external debt, environmental damage, illicit drugs, abuses against women, the mistreatment of migrant workers - would be more effectively addressed if Governments, societies and the international community were to place people at the centre of development and international cooperation. This is what the World Summit for Social Development is intended to do. We urge the worlds leaders and their Governments to ensure maximum participation in this milestone event in Copenhagen in 1995.


The world has changed radically, largely for the better. But old problems remain, and new challenges confront us. To respond to these problems under the new circumstances, and to deal with these new challenges, our Organization, the United Nations, must renew itself.


In few aspects of the work of the United Nations is this need for renewal more evident than in the Security Council. The structure of the Security Council was formulated at the very birth of the United Nations, at the end of the Second World War and the beginning of the cold war. Forty-eight years have passed. Massive changes have occurred in the world, particularly in recent years. Empires have crumbled. The ideological division of the world has melted away. The cold war has ended. The membership of the United Nations has multiplied from 51 at the time of its founding to 184 today.


And yet, apart from the enlargement of its membership 30 years ago from 9 nine to 15, the Security Council has not changed. It has remained small, unrepresentative, undemocratic, opaque. We recognize the reality of continuing imbalances in world power and the necessity for the Security Council to reflect this reality. But, surely, we must also recognize the reality of the worldwide trend towards, and the peoples desire for, democratization and transparency in political affairs. Surely, the Security Council, the United Nations body with the greatest impact on international peace and security, must also reflect this reality in its size, in its structure, in its procedures, in its relations with other United Nations bodies, including the General Assembly.


We are, therefore, in favour of a searching reassessment of the structure, role and procedures of the Security Council with a view to its reform. And we urge that, in view of the repercussions that such a reform would have on other United Nations bodies and activities, this reassessment be carried out within the context of a thorough review of the Charter. The sober, rational and realistic proposals propounded yesterday by the Foreign Minister of Singapore might serve as a useful starting-point for our consideration of this important matter.


The entire United Nations is, in fact, in need of reform. In the new international situation, the enlarged demands upon the United Nations and the constraints on the available means require that the resources of the United Nations be carefully husbanded for their most efficient use. The concept and substance of management - and by that I mean the science of management - must be imposed upon the United Nations bureaucracy. Funds and other assets must be most meticulously safeguarded and effectively utilized. Duplication must be avoided, costs drastically cut, waste radically reduced, and corruption abolished.


I am sure that many developing countries share our desire that the United Nations should impose upon itself the austerity and discipline that are required of many of us by the international financial institutions.


We pay a tribute to the Secretary-Generals attention to this aspect of his work. We welcome in particular the creation of the new post of Assistant Secretary-General for Inspections and Investigations as an indication of his determination to address this problem.


The Philippines is up to date in its contribution to the finances of the United Nations. It may be a small amount in the totality of the Organizations resources, but it is substantial in proportion to our financial capacity. We would not want to see it squandered. We cannot afford it. Neither can the United Nations.


May I propose, then, that a group of men and women with both extensive experience and skill in corporate management and extensive exposure to the special requirements and problems of the United Nations be commissioned to study this question in greater depth and detail and with greater objectivity, and to make the appropriate recommendations. There are many in this Hall right now who would be eminently qualified to perform this task. The Philippines will explore the possibility of a draft resolution to this effect at a suitable time.


This is a matter of great and urgent necessity. For reforms in the United Nations will place the Organization in a better position to deal with the demands upon it in the second half-century of its existence and to fulfil in the next millennium the vision that its founding fathers had for this great and indispensable Organization."	1993-10-07
Roberto R. Romulo	UNGA 49	"Please allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the exalted office of President of the General Assembly. Your distinguished career and your experience in international affairs, together with your outstanding personal qualities, assure us of wise and skilled leadership at the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly.


As we approach the fiftieth year of the life of our Organization, let us look back to the first principles of its existence. Let us see how we can apply those principles to the dynamic realities of our time and, to the extent that human discernment will allow, to the uncertain circumstances of the next half century.


Emerging from the unspeakable horror and devastation of untrammelled global conflict, the international community brought forth the United Nations as an instrument, above all, for preventing conflict and keeping the peace. This mission was to be carried out, if possible, through the encouragement of the peaceful settlement of disputes by the contending parties themselves or, if necessary, through the interposition of armed force by the United Nations.


As with any human institution, the United Nations record in this regard has been mixed. We find that the United Nations has been effective in keeping the peace in those cases in which both the parties to the disputes and the major Powers involved have turned  or have been compelled to turn  to the international community to separate the contending forces and allow them a respite from war. This we have seen in such places as Cyprus, Angola, Mozambique, Liberia and certain parts of the Middle East, including Lebanon.


In recent years, a singular success was achieved in my own part of the world when in Cambodia, upon the resolve of the international community and the Cambodian parties themselves, the United Nations not only enforced the peace but also managed the transition to a regime of peace and national reconciliation.


Contending with matters of war and peace has engaged the greater portion of the attention and preoccupation of the United Nations and of the international community. However, our founding fathers recognized from the very beginning that it is not enough to head off crises and intervene in conflicts, but that the roots of war and peace lie in the human condition and the human mind. It is thus there, at their roots, that mankind must deal with questions of war and peace.


As we look back at this half-century, we see with extraordinary clarity that the enduring triumphs of the international community have come not with the imposition of outside force but when the deepest concerns of the nations and peoples involved are addressed and resolved. In the past year, two such triumphs brightened, like twin comets, the history of the human community, forcefully demonstrating yet again this essential reality. These triumphant achievements came in precisely those two areas that had most deeply engaged the United Nations for the greater part of its existence  South Africa and the Middle East.


In South Africa, national peace and reconciliation in a regime of democracy emerged victorious after decades of struggle, led by the United Nations, against apartheid and on behalf of human dignity, racial equality, majority rule and political pluralism. This happened only after most of the political forces in the country recognized these universal values as essential to the survival of the South African nation.


In the Middle East, the dramatic breakthrough worked out by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) has opened the doors of hope for an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict. This was made possible by the tenacious insistence of the international community, mainly through the United Nations, on the right of the Palestinian people to govern themselves and on the right of all States in the region to a secure existence within internationally recognized boundaries. It finally occurred because the leaders of Israel and the PLO and other Arab leaders recognized the essential nature of these rights.


Sadly, savage conflicts continue to ravage lives in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Somalia, Rwanda and other areas experiencing similar tragedies, mainly because people of influence among the various ethnic groups, tribes and clans have not accepted the fundamental truth of their common humanity.


For a long time, the United Nations has advanced the proposition that economic development  raising the income of a nation as a whole  was vital to peace and stability in the world. The United Nations is certainly right to emphasize this important reality. In many cases, extreme poverty has led to despair and to a sense of outrage over the perceived injustice of living in penury and deprivation in a world of affluence and profligate consumption, of being inadequately compensated for the use by others of ones nations human and natural resources, and of being doomed to a chronic inability to shake off an unpayable debt to foreign creditors. Fortunately, many developing nations  and the Philippines is proud to take its place among them have made hard political decisions and adopted economic policies favourable to dynamic and sustained economic growth.


These are thus hopeful times for economic growth, at least for those countries in a position to take advantage of a more liberal international trading regime. However, as many countries, and the United Nations itself, have realized, economic development by itself is not enough. Raising the overall income of a nation is not enough. A larger gross national product does not necessarily mean a better life for the individual citizen. A bigger economy by itself does not satisfy the individual persons aspiration to human fulfilment.


Indeed, economic growth cannot be sustained for long unless the individual citizen and the individual community have a stake in that growth and unless they are mobilized and empowered to take active part in the process of development. Economic growth would be meaningless to the individual who does not share in its benefits or whose community is destroyed by it. Development is empty for persons who are deprived of their individual rights and freedoms. A society cannot find fulfilment in growth, and indeed the development process itself is severely hampered, if it does not take adequate care of its vulnerable groups: women, children, ethnic minorities, the handicapped, the homeless. Development cannot be sustained unless the nurturing qualities of the natural environment are conserved for future generations.


Care for citizens fulfilment as human beings, for their community and for society cannot wait. It cannot wait for total peace to be achieved or for a certain level of development to be attained. All these  peace, development, and the quality of society and of human life  must proceed simultaneously.


We in the Philippines have learned this lesson the hard way and are now applying it faithfully. We have secured peace and national reconciliation through a peace process that includes having sincere discussions with dissident elements and extending a generous amnesty to them. We have granted a substantial degree of autonomy and self-rule to our ethnic minorities, particularly the Muslim community. We have devolved extensive authority, responsibility and resources on local governments and communities, and we have restored the system of democratic pluralism, through which the people and their groups can thrash out their grievances and advance their interests in peace and with civility.


At the same time, we have pursued a purposeful programme of economic development through the liberalization of the conditions governing trade, investments, and banking and finance, and through the privatization of Government enterprises. We have provided infrastructure facilities and generous incentives for domestic and foreign investors. These, together with the restoration of political stability, have placed us back on the road to economic recovery and self-sustaining growth.


Simultaneously, we have adopted a social agenda through a broad national consensus. In accordance with that agenda we have endeavoured to improve the quality of life of our people, not only because such an improvement is their inherent right, and not only because the ultimate purpose of development, in our view, is the welfare of the individual and his community, but also because we know that the best way to spur economic development is to afford the people a stake in it and because we recognize that the people are an economys most vital resource.


We are thus jealously safeguarding the individual Filipinos fundamental rights and freedoms. Part of this effort is the importance that we place on human-rights education for all, including the armed forces and the police, a mission that is mandated by a unique provision in our Constitution.


We are expanding the empowerment of our people and their communities, particularly of the most vulnerable groups. We have devoted attention and resources to the concerns of women, including women workers, and of children, particularly those of the poor. We have protected the rights and culture of our ethnic minorities. And we have allocated substantial resources to health and education for the development of our people as our most valuable asset.


We in the Philippines believe that this simultaneous and balanced approach to peace, development and the quality of individual lives must be applied in the international community as well as within nations, in the family of man as well as in national societies. The expansion of the global economy is important for peace in the world and the progress of nations, but it is not enough. Each country must have a stake in this expansion and an enlarged share of it.


Even this is not enough. The international community must go beyond nations in its ministrations. It must devote greater attention to care and respect for people and to the recognition of the inherent equality of all human beings  regardless of gender, of age, of race, of religion, of language, of culture or of nationality.


We must all remember that the sources of conflict do not lie only in disputes over territory or resources. As we know only too well, they arise also, and it seems increasingly, from intolerance of other peoples beliefs and cultures and from the less than human treatment of people from other lands.


Mankind has made progress in advancing the truth that there are certain things that transcend national boundaries and are the common heritage, the common concern and the common responsibility of all nations and of mankind as a whole. Among these are the environment and the oceans and their resources.


There is something else that transcends national boundaries and summons global responsibility, something that is of infinitely greater worth than even the environment or the oceans. I am speaking of the worlds most vulnerable human groups. I speak specifically of migrant workers, refugees, children, the aged and the disabled, and the special concerns of the worlds women.


The transnational migration of workers is an increasingly prominent phenomenon of international life in our time. This is the result of supply and demand for workers seeking equilibrium. Migrant workers, however, are more than a commodity to be traded in the international market-place. They have the same dignity and rights as any of us in this Hall. Moreover, they make a vital contribution to the economies and societies of the countries in which they live and work.


And yet, many countries, including developing countries, treat migrant workers as being less than the human beings that they are. At best, these workers are left unprotected by the law governing labour and employment. The international community, the United Nations, cannot allow the abuse of these vulnerable and valuable members of the human family to continue.


We urge member States to ratify or accede to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families as an expression of their recognition of the common humanity that they share with migrants and their families.


The Secretary-General might form a group to submit recommendations to the Assembly at our next session on improving coordination of the various efforts of the United Nations on behalf of migrant workers. And I call upon the High Commissioner for Human Rights to make the rights of migrant workers one of his priority concerns.


I reiterate the call for a global conference on international migration and development, which was supported by many delegations at the recent International Conference on Population and Development, held in Cairo. Natural and man-made disasters have created large-scale flows of refugees around the world. While the distinction between refugees and economic migrants has to be resolutely made, genuine refugees must be given all the protection that international conventions call for.


Children, by their very nature, have a claim to mankinds protection and care. That claim is special in the case of street children, children coerced into drug addiction, refugee children and children in the areas of armed conflict or natural disasters. National societies and the international community must ensure that such children are provided with adequate food, medical care, shelter and education. We may need to draw up a convention dealing with the sale of children, child prostitution, child pornography and the nefarious trade in body parts of children.


The rights, education and empowerment of women around the world are of special importance to the United Nations and to the world, as they have everything to do with some of mankinds most vital concerns the health and education of children, the advancement of the economy, the preservation of the environment and the management of the countrys and the worlds population. We in the Philippines look forward to the Fourth World Conference on Women, and call for the inclusion in its platform of action of measures for the protection and advancement of womens rights, particularly of women in positions of great vulnerability, including women migrant workers, women refugees, and minority women. 


We also call upon the Ninth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders to take steps towards making gender-based violence a crime, especially violence against women migrant workers and the victims of the traffic in women. Underlying the need to safeguard the welfare of these vulnerable groups is the fundamental issue of human rights, the issue of respect for all people and their rights, the issue of their inherent equality as human beings. The United Nations has adopted numerous international instruments on human rights, beginning with the Universal Declaration. The Philippines is party to 21 of these.


The United Nations must renew its commitment to foster compliance with these solemn covenants, always with respect for the sovereignty of nations. Since the concept of the inherent rights and equality of human persons resides in the minds of people, United Nations efforts in this regard must begin with education. As our Constitution proclaims, human-rights education is itself a human right. Our delegation reaffirms its full support for a proposal introduced last year for the declaration of a United Nations decade on human rights education. At the same time, the United Nations human rights machinery must be strengthened, particularly the new office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Centre for Human Rights. Even as we refocus our concerns on basic human needs, we should not lose sight of the continuing, and even increased, importance of peace-keeping in the mandate of the United Nations. We must, however, make sure that the peace-keeping function does not divert resources from economic and social development, is not used by the major Powers simply to pursue their respective agendas, and is carried out in a transparent and democratic manner.


The Philippines fully supports an approach to international peace and security that is based on securing friendly relations among peoples of different political, cultural, ethnic and religious backgrounds, respect for international law, and the peaceful settlement of disputes. We believe that the maintenance of international peace and security should not rest primarily on the use or threat of sanctions, armed force, or other coercive measures. Nor should peace-keeping operations, important as they are, take the place of the political settlement of disputes.


In light of this, and because of the growing number and complexity of United Nations peace-keeping operations, we in the United Nations have to agree on a set of guiding principles for the establishment and conduct of such operations. Such a set of guidelines would not only contribute to the effectiveness of the peace-keeping operations but also broaden the base of active support for them. The maintenance of international peace and security is a collective responsibility. The United Nations must ensure the international nature of all peace-keeping operations if it is to maintain their credibility.


It is in this spirit that we approach the live question of the reform of the Security Council. It is ironic that, in the midst of the rapid spread of democracy within nations in recent years and the expanding membership of the United Nations, the Security Council remains unrepresentative in its size and in the geographic distribution of its membership and undemocratic in its decision-making and working methods.


Clearly, while the composition and methods of the Security Council must reflect the realities of political and economic power, we have to redress the imbalance in its composition and increase the participation of the general membership and other United Nations organs in its decision-making, if we are to enhance its effectiveness and its accountability. This would involve both enlarging the Councils membership and reforming its methods and procedures.


Specifically, we believe that the Councils membership should be better balanced in terms of geographic distribution and increased representation of the developing countries. At the same time, the Security Council has to improve the transparency of its working methods and decision-making processes, which, in turn, would enhance its working relationship with the general membership and the other principal organs of the United Nations, especially the General Assembly. 


We look forward to early action on this aspiration by the working group of the General Assembly dealing with the expansion of the Security Council and related matters. The General Assembly, for its part, must revitalize itself if it is to carry out its functions and discharge its responsibilities under the Charter, including those pertaining to the maintenance of international peace and security in which it must assert its role as the only principal organ with universal membership. In the past two years, the General Assembly adopted two resolutions to this effect. Let us begin implementing their key provisions.


Revitalization of the United Nations is demanded by the new circumstances and challenges of todays dynamic world. Let us, at the very least, do our very best to uphold and strengthen the principle of universality in our Organization.


It is in the interest of revitalizing the United Nations that the effective management of the Organization assumes enormous importance. The Philippine delegation welcomes the creation by the General Assembly of the Office of Internal Oversight Services. We suggest, however, that the Assembly consider the possible establishment of an independent advisory group to oversee the work and receive the reports of this Office.


This would provide the checks and balances so necessary in a large organization such as the United Nations. As the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations approaches, we must ensure that the balance is maintained among the principal concerns of the Organization  the maintenance of peace and security, the promotion of economic progress and the advancement of social development.


Because it has lagged behind the first two of the preoccupations of the United Nations, I suggest that we now pay closer attention and turn our efforts more to the third of our Organizations principal concerns  the social component of the basic needs of the human community and the human person.


As we approach this important milestone of the Organization, it is altogether fitting that we focus the work of the United Nations on the human person and society, whose interest and welfare, after all, are the ultimate reason for the existence of the United Nations and the final objective of its works."	1994-10-05
Domingo L. Siazon Jr.	UNGA 50	"It is with special fervour that I congratulate Mr. Freitas do Amaral, on behalf of the Philippine delegation, on his election as President of the United Nations General Assembly in this landmark session. Let me also express the gratitude of my delegation to Mr. Amara Essy, the Foreign Minister of Cte dIvoire, for the excellent leadership which he provided us at our forty-ninth session. Our tribute goes also to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali and to the men and women of the Secretariat, who, in the course of the past year, carried out their indispensable tasks under circumstances of great difficulty for them and for the Organization.


In three weeks, most of the worlds Heads of State or Government will gather in this Hall to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the United Nations. They will no doubt recall how the founding fathers of our Organization convened in San Francisco, animated by their resolve to transform the world. It was a world devastated by a global war. Like most wars, it was ignited by the propensity and ability of nations to use force to acquire territory and resources, to avenge past wrongs, or to promote, at the expense of others, the security and welfare of their people.


This was the world which the United Nations was created to transform. Our founding fathers were idealistic enough to insist that questions of war and peace had ultimately to be resolved in the hearts and minds of men and nations; but they were realistic enough to recognize that practical measures and considerations were necessary to deter the use of force and mitigate its effects. They were realistic enough to concede that States that held a preponderance of military force had to be allowed a large measure of authority and responsibility; but they were idealistic enough to hope that those States would use their power for the good of all.


With the hindsight of 50 years, we can see that the United Nations has not fulfilled the vision that the founders had for it, but it succeeded well beyond what it was reasonable to expect of it at that time. The world was spared yet another global cataclysm. The quiet work of the United Nations, particularly through its specialized agencies, advanced the well-being and raised the standard of living of countless millions around the world.


Sadly, however, these considerable achievements were offset, in a fundamental way, by the continued and repeated defiance of the United Nations proclaimed purposes by so many men and nations, in so many instances. Almost from the beginning of the existence of the United Nations, and despite the United Nations, man persisted in his ability, propensity and willingness to use force in order to achieve his national or ideological ends. If peace was kept on a global scale, it was only because the mutual threat of nuclear annihilation deterred the launching of full-scale war. In the international economy, countries sought to beggar their neighbours through the unabashed use of a full range of protectionist and mercantilist tools.


Today, however, in the fiftieth year of the United Nations, we can say with a measure of plausibility, that the world has indeed been transformed; and we can hope, with a degree of realism, that the idealistic vision of the United Nations can be substantially attained. One of the central aims of the United Nations  the liberation of colonized nations  has been largely achieved. The worlds most mightily armed Powers have pulled back from the brink of nuclear annihilation. No longer do nuclear-armed ideological camps face each other in deadly confrontation, and mankinds survival no longer hangs in the perilous balance of mutual nuclear threat. The Philippines is gratified by the decision earlier this year to extend indefinitely the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and calls for the conclusion early next year of a comprehensive test-ban treaty that would put an absolute end to all nuclear testing.


The international community has reached agreement on the elimination of other devices of mass destruction and of inhumane weapons. In particular, the Philippines urges the ratification and the strengthening of the 1980 Convention on the Prohibition of Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to have Indiscriminate Effects. We call for the early entry into force of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, and the full implementation of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) Weapons and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction.


In place of the use and threat of force, more and more nations have resorted to dialogue and reconciliation in dealing with disputes among themselves or with their neighbours, even in the case of conflicts which the realistic had considered to be insoluble. Almost throughout its entire existence, the United Nations has been seized with the conflicts in the Middle East. But only four days ago, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, with the approbation of other States in the area, took another significant step on the difficult road to peace. In South Africa, where a minority regime long oppressed the majority with systematic cruelty, a multiracial Government now administers the country with success that has surpassed even the worlds most fervent expectations. In Latin America, old territorial disputes are now the subject of dialogue and consultation.


In our own region, the political settlement of the conflict in Cambodia and the emergence of an elected government in that long-suffering country stand as crowning achievements of the United Nations, as well as of the countries of the region  a triumph of negotiation over the force of arms. We welcome the accord that was so painstakingly crafted a year ago to avert the development of nuclear arms in the Korean peninsula. We urge the resumption of serious talks between North and South Korea as a further contribution to peace and reconciliation in our region. The Government of Myanmar has agreed on a cease-fire and has undertaken negotiations with all but one of the minority nationalities in Myanmar, a remarkable development in a country riven by inter-ethnic conflict for so long.


Matching the spread of the spirit of dialogue and reconciliation, faith in the efficacy of market forces and economic liberalization as a condition and stimulant of development has been sweeping the world. Policies arising from this faith have unleashed the productive energies of many of the worlds people, a development largely responsible for the remarkable economic growth of countries in many parts of the world. Liberalization of international economic transactions and the resulting interdependence of the global economy have raised the stake of nations in one anothers prosperity and have thus considerably brightened the prospects of enduring stability and peace. Thus, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council, of which the Philippines is an active founding participant, is devoted solely to economic collaboration. But one of its salutary by-products is the strengthening of peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region, for now APEC participants have a growing stake in one anothers economic progress and political stability. We find in my country, the Philippines, a microcosm of the global trend of political reconciliation, economic liberalization, and regionalism. The peace talks that we are undertaking with rebel groups in the spirit of national reconciliation have brought a new stability to the country, providing the atmosphere of tranquillity so necessary for the resurgence of the economy.


The military rebels have availed themselves of a programme of amnesty. Many of them now pursue their ambitions for the country through the legal political system, with one of them recently elected as a Senator of the Republic. The Government has been negotiating in Europe with the self-exiled leaders of the Communist Party, which is now legal in the Philippines and whose members are free to contest Philippine elections. With the assistance of the Committee of Six of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, under the chairmanship of Indonesia, negotiations are taking place with the Moro National Liberation Front. These negotiations have resulted in a cease-fire and agreement on more than 80 per cent of the points at issue. Peace in the southern Philippines has made possible an extraordinary surge in the economic growth of that region. We have opened wide the doors to the Philippine economy, welcoming foreign investment, letting in the bracing wind of foreign competition. We have lowered our barriers to trade in fulfilment of international commitments or through unilateral measures. One of the results of these structural reforms is a growth rate that is respectable even by the standards of our fast-growing region. There are bright prospects for the continuation of this growth rate because it proceeds from solid policy foundations and is taking place within a system of pluralistic democracy, respect for human rights, and the rule of law.


We have strengthened our bonds with our neighbours, through the Association of South-East Asian Nations above all. We have dealt with border questions and territorial disputes, including the conflicting claims in the South China Sea, through peaceful dialogue and consultation. The general improvement in global security, the rising tide of global prosperity, and the intensification of regional cooperation should give rise to hope, but it should not induce complacency, as new threats have arisen to confront us and old ones have swollen in magnitude and virulence. The dissolution of power blocs has unleashed latent tribalism that had been under authoritarian constraint. One of the most savage manifestations of this has been taking place in Bosnia and Herzegovina.


International terrorism has become a global menace. The illicit trade in drugs undermines the fabric of society. Trafficking in women and children is a crime that cries out for international cooperative countermeasures. The recent resumption of nuclear testing by two of the nuclear-weapon States poses an immediate threat to peoples health, the natural environment, and the non-proliferation regime. We repeat our condemnation of these tests and ask that they stop  now and forever. Even as the notion of economic liberalization has been almost universally embraced as a condition and catalyst for development, many countries have resorted to inventive measures of disguised protectionism. Numerous developing countries continue to labour, like Sisyphus, under the crushing burden of foreign debt.


Shortages of labour in resource-rich or rapidly industrializing economies have induced the large-scale migration of workers across national boundaries. Their presence in foreign lands has placed them in positions of vulnerability that require international cooperation for the protection of their rights and dignity as human beings.


The Philippines calls upon all States to ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families. The Philippines is at one with the Group of 77 in calling for a United Nations-sponsored global conference on international migration.


My delegation intends to pursue with great vigour General Assembly resolutions on violence against women migrant workers and on trafficking in women and girls. These are some of the more outstanding challenges that confront the United Nations as it enters its second half-century and approaches the next millennium. The United Nations, however, cannot respond to the challenges of today and the next century with the organization and procedures of 50 years ago. The nature of the new threats to international peace and security requires a review of United Nations peace-keeping operations in order to streamline them and make them more effective.


At this stage, I must stress that, whatever measures are agreed upon, they must be financed adequately, in proportion to the capacity and degree of responsibility of Member States and not by sacrificing any development programmes.


The United Nations is in a desperate financial situation. We cannot demand that it fulfil tasks that we are unwilling to finance. We cannot simply use the United Nations and then withhold from it the resources needed for its effective functioning. Year after year, we call for better management of the United Nations. The Philippines supports this call, and strongly articulated its position in this Hall last year.


At the same time, we must point out that the United Nations cannot be managed efficiently if it is constantly uncertain of the resources available to it. We therefore appeal to all Member States, particularly the larger contributors, to make up their arrears, to pay their dues, and to pay on time.


We have of late heard the proposition that in trying to achieve economy and efficiency in the United Nations we should look to the economic and social area, to those bodies whose mandate is to advance the interests of the developing countries  abolishing agencies here, gutting programmes there. We support the streamlining of multilateral development institutions and programmes. But we cannot accept moves to abolish the development agencies in the name of the ""division of labour"" or comparative advantage. What the international community needs to do with respect to these agencies  and the Bretton Woods institutions and the regional development banks  is to augment their resources, not to reduce them. We deplore the position of some Powers that refuse to raise their contributions to the international and regional financial institutions, but in their desire to maintain a dominant role in those bodies prevent others from increasing their own share.


We have all come to this session ready to address the question of reform of the structure of the Security Council. The Councils structure is no longer adequate to meet the new and enlarged demands upon its mandate and no longer reflects the size and composition of the United Nations. The Philippines fully supports the enlargement of the Councils membership in order to ensure the equitable representation of all regions and of the developing countries. Any reform, however, must go beyond the question of membership. The question of the veto must be reviewed, as must the Councils working methods and procedures, in order to ensure the greatest transparency possible and the participation of as broad a range of countries as possible. The vital nature of its decisions requires no less. At the same time, the growing importance of the role of the United Nations requires that its membership, as well as its functions, reflect the realities of today. 


Accordingly, we need to consider the proposition that, in the high interests of universality, no significant group of people should be left without representation in the United Nations. In this fiftieth year, as we recall the founding principles and fundamental goals of our Organization, as we review its mandate and as we assess its strengths and weaknesses, its achievements and shortcomings, we must never lose sight of the fact that all our labours in the United Nations have as their centre and object the human person  his or her security, dignity and well-being  above ideology, above religion, above even the State itself. With the shrinking of this planet Earth, a process helped in no small measure by the United Nations itself, hundreds of millions more people are crying out for their own empowerment and for the universal respect of their rights and dignity.


In this fiftieth year of our Organization, we in the United Nations must heed their cry if we are to keep faith with its mandate and mission."	1995-10-02
Domingo L. Siazon Jr.	UNGA 51	"On behalf of my delegation, Sir, I take pleasure in extending to you our heartfelt felicitations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session. We in the Philippines and in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) derive special gratification from congratulating you, a citizen of an ASEAN country, on this great honour.


The Philippines pays tribute to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has led our Organization in the most difficult circumstances.


I must beg your indulgence, Mr. President, and that of our colleagues to speak briefly about recent events in my country, developments which we consider historic, opening a bright new chapter in the history of the Philippines. Exactly a month ago, on 2 September, the Philippine Government and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), which had waged a rebellion for more than a quarter of a century, signed an agreement ending the conflict in Mindanao and establishing a zone of peace and development in that island-region.


On 9 September, Professor Nur Misuari, leader of the MNLF, ran for and was elected to the office of Governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao, which is, by virtue of a plebiscite, composed of four provinces in which Muslim Filipinos are in the majority.


At the same time, in accordance with the 2 September agreement, the Southern Philippines Council for Peace and Development is being organized under the leadership of the MNLF to help promote peace and development in 14 provinces and nine cities in the southern Philippines. Thus has the Philippines opted for national reconciliation as the only true road to peace and development.


Here, I pay tribute and give thanks to the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), and to the OICs Committee of Six on the Situation of the Muslims in the Southern Philippines, under the wise and vigorous leadership of Indonesia and with the especially active involvement of Libya, for guiding us along that road towards the goal which we have now achieved.


I mention this because I know that what is essentially a domestic development in the Philippines finds resonance in other places and in the world at large. We all know only too well that conflicts arising from ethnic and cultural differences are not unique to the Philippines. But just as the Mindanao conflict was not unique, neither was the process of reconciliation that ended it. We consider the settlement in Mindanao a reflection of the salutary trend towards peace and reconciliation in the world, as well as a modest contribution to it.


In South Africa, the racist abomination that was apartheid has been abolished, and a multiracial Government based on the rule of the majority and the rights of the minority has been put in place, lending new stability to southern Africa.


In the Middle East, nations in contention agreed to take the road of peace. Regrettably, recent events have shown that the road is still strewn with obstacles. We retain the faith that these obstacles are surmountable with good will and a firm conviction that peace must not be destroyed again in a land so revered by people of many faiths. Our most fervent prayers go to the leaders and nations involved that they may soon return to the path of mutual understanding, reconciliation, justice and peace, for both the Palestinian and the Israeli peoples.


In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we can at least hope that the Dayton accords, as well as the 14 September and subsequent elections, will put behind us the singular horror of ethnic cleansing and lead to a situation where different ethnic groups can live once again in peace and tolerance. In this hemisphere, the Government of Guatemala and armed dissidents have achieved an accord of security and justice.


In our own region of South-East Asia, we look forward to the completion of a new Constitution by Myanmar that will provide a place in the nations political life for the nationalities that have for so long been in rebellion and for political groups of many persuasions. Unfortunately, inter-ethnic conflicts in far too many places continue to inflict suffering on innocent people  notably, for example, in Rwanda and Burundi. Around the world, simmering beneath the surface, are grievances arising from growing disparities in economic well-being and social status within States and nations. However, on a global scale, there is a clear trend towards reconciliation and tolerance. As it is within nations, so is it between nations. We may be witnessing a new era, one not only of relative peace but also of close cooperation in dealing with the global challenges of today.


The Cold War has ended, and with it the deadly reality of armed confrontation between nuclear-armed blocs.


Even the old North-South economic divide is being subsumed in a new global trading regime and in regional economic arrangements, such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, in which the interests of both developed and developing countries are taken into account. These developments in reconciliation and cooperation give us hope that mankind can find the will to work together in meeting the old and new challenges that confront the world as a whole.


I see six major challenges that are central to the future welfare and the very survival of mankind. The first has to do with the surfeit of weapons that continues to plague the world, particularly the continued deployment and development of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction, the expanding volume of the traffic in conventional arms and the continued production and persistent use of especially injurious devices of war.


The second lies in the potential for conflict over maritime jurisdictions and resources and the need for stable maritime regimes. Another is mankinds continuing assault on the environment, putting into question the sustainability of the worlds development. Yet another challenge is the need to maintain the momentum of the liberalization of international trade while cushioning weaker nations and vulnerable sectors of society from its undesirable effects. The fifth challenge is the necessity of ensuring human welfare and dignity within the nation- State and within society. The sixth and last is the growing menace of organized criminal gangs purveying terror, deadly weapons, illicit drugs, indentured labour, and the bodies of our women and children across international borders.


We have made significant progress in the control of arms; but the world remains a dangerous place, and much work remains to be done. We have extended indefinitely the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Many of us have signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty that the General Assembly adopted last month. But we should not stop there, for these are but steps on the road towards complete nuclear disarmament. We continue to call upon the nuclearweapon States to take seriously their commitment under Article VI of the NPT to negotiate in good faith the abolition of nuclear weapons.


Towards this end, the Philippines once more joins the call for the parties to the NPT to draw up an international convention prohibiting the use and threat of use of nuclear weapons. As another step, we reiterate the call for the conclusion of an international convention against the production and stockpiling of fissile materials. Sir, last December in Bangkok, your Prime Minister and my President, together with the Heads of Government of the eight other countries of South-East Asia, signed the South east Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone Treaty. We urge the nuclear-weapon States to commit themselves to respect this Treatys provisions by adhering to its protocol. Together with the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco), the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty (Treaty of Rarotonga), the Pelindaba Text of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty, and that for Antarctica, the South-East Asian Treaty is a major step towards a southern hemisphere free of nuclear weapons. We support the political linkage among these nuclear-free zones, as was recently proposed.


Of particular concern to us is the unacceptably large number of innocent persons, including a disproportionate number of young children, killed or maimed by landmines. The Philippines has ratified the Convention and its Protocol restricting the use of excessively injurious weapons, landmines, booby traps and similar devices. We have joined the move towards a global ban on anti-personnel mines. In this spirit, President Ramos while on a visit last December to Cambodia, a country ravaged by landmines, ordered the immediate destruction of the Claymore mines which were then still in the inventory of the armed forces of the Philippines. Compliance with the Presidents instructions has been completed.


Another potential threat to global and regional peace and security has been the developing scramble for jurisdiction, resources and strategic position in the worlds oceans. This has been strongly evident in the situation in the South China Sea, which for the most part is surrounded by South-East Asian States.


Fortunately, the international community has had the collective wisdom to agree on a set of rules, primarily in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, to govern the use of the sea. Not least, the Convention subjects maritime jurisdictions to the rule of law, defining the nature and limits of those jurisdictions and providing the legal framework for their establishment and for negotiating settlements where they overlap. The world is threatened not only by weapons of war and by disputes over territory, but also by mankinds assault on the worlds fragile environment. The Philippines is firmly committed to the protection of the environment within its national jurisdiction.


Environmental protection is a vital consideration in the approval of major development projects. We shall conserve the ecological integrity of the Philippines' exclusive economic zone as well as of its internal waters. As an archipelagic country whose exclusive economic zone extends to a portion of the South China Sea, the Philippines places particular importance on preserving the ecological integrity of that body of water, and would welcome the sharing of knowledge and experience gained from efforts to protect the environment in similar bodies of water elsewhere in the world.


A potential threat to the environment arises from the growing use of nuclear energy in the generation of electricity. This growth has been particularly rapid in East Asia, producing nuclear waste with corresponding rapidity. While nuclear power is relatively clean as a source of energy, accidents in the operation of nuclear plants and in the disposal of nuclear waste can cause devastation for the environment as well as for human lives. Equally damaging is the reckless manner in which decommissioned nuclear power plants and nuclear-powered vessels are discarded. It is time for the international community to address this burgeoning problem with the seriousness and urgency that it deserves. Last May, President Ramos proposed the possible organization of ASIATOM, an international body to look into this concern in East Asia and to devise measures to deal with it.


Along with the breakup of empires, the dissolution of hostile alliances, and the spread of the spirit of reconciliation within and between nations, one salutary global development in recent years has been the establishment of an international trading regime based on the increasingly free exchange of goods and services. This development was made possible by the embrace by nearly all the world of market forces as the most efficient way of creating wealth for the worlds people.


The efficacy of this principle of international economic relations has been demonstrated in South-East Asia, where countries have opened up their markets to one another, through the Free Trade Area of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, and to the world for the benefit of all. Next month the Philippines will have the honour of hosting the annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (APEC), including an informal meeting of leaders of the 18 participating economies on the Pacific rim.


At that meeting, we will consolidate plans of individual APEC economies into a coherent Manila action plan for APEC that will free up and ease trade, and that will attain the target set for free trade by the year 2010 for the developed participants and by 2020 for the developing economies. The plan includes ways of engaging in economic and technical cooperation, particularly in order to help the less developed economies to adjust to the freetrade regime envisioned in APEC.


A few weeks after the APEC meeting, the first Ministerial Meeting of the World Trade Organization, to be held in Singapore, will review the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements and seek to develop a work programme to sustain the momentum of global trade liberalization through further negotiations on specific sectors.


The Philippines is strongly committed to the opening up of its economy. In affirming this basic policy of our country, we must ask our economic partners, particularly the developed ones, to desist from circumventing their own commitments to a free international trading regime by providing subsidies to their uncompetitive sectors and by extending them protection in the guise of labour rights or environmental conservation. We must reject this kind of tactic.


We must also urge that the subject and object of development human beings, their welfare and dignity  not be overlooked. We also believe that the status of women is central to both economic growth and human development. The Philippines therefore calls upon all of us to carry out effectively and in full the Platform of Action adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women and to devote adequate resources to make this possible. In accordance with our convictions on the status and rights of women, validated at the Beijing conference, the Philippines has actively pressed for international action to combat those scourges that plague the human race: violence against women and trafficking in women and children. Because of the international dimension of these blights on the human condition, the United Nations and the international community must keep them high on the international agenda until the human race is freed of them. The Philippines and other countries similarly situated have a special concern for women migrant workers because of their peculiar vulnerability to violence and abuse.


The Philippines stand on the rights of women and children rests on our peoples deep conviction of the inherent sacredness of the rights of all human persons, families and communities everywhere on this planet  their rights to freedom, dignity, participation in their own governance and to development. Our lives, our well-being and our rights are constantly threatened by the activities of transnational criminal gangs. Some of these gangs traffic in drugs. Some steal and smuggle cars. Some deal in the illicit buying and selling of arms. Others engage in terror for a variety of causes. Still others traffic in women, children, or people eager for work.


The Philippines is prepared to consider the draft convention proposed by Poland on measures to combat organized crime. We commend Poland for this timely initiative.


The United Nations is the keystone of mankinds efforts on behalf of disarmament, the rule of law in the worlds oceans, the preservation of the Earth and its environment, economic and social development, the fight against organized crime, and the protection of human rights. Because of its central and growing importance in human affairs, the Philippines firmly believes that the United Nations must be constantly renewed and invigorated to enable it to respond to the challenges that face each generation.


The Philippines favours the enlargement of the Security Councils permanent membership through the addition of countries that are politically and economically able and willing to assume the responsibilities of such membership. At the same time, we believe in greater representation on the basis of equitable geographical distribution. The various innovative proposals now on the table deserve close examination. But the issue of membership cannot be considered in isolation; it has to be addressed in the context of reform of the Security Council  reform towards greater transparency and democracy of its working methods and reform towards a more balanced relationship with the General Assembly, which must retain pre-eminence in the affairs of the United Nations.


However, no structural changes in the United Nations will be effective unless it is assured of the necessary flow of financial resources. Our Organization, no matter how much reform takes place, can function effectively only if it knows with reasonable certainty whether and when it can pay its staff and meet the other obligations arising from operations that, after all, are mandated, often unanimously, by the Member States themselves.


Simple mathematical calculations will demonstrate that the financial crisis of the United Nations cannot be eased unless we all comply with the financial obligations that we freely undertook. We must pay our dues in full, on time and without conditions. Specifically, the United Nations can rest on fairly stable financial foundations if all of us pay our contributions to the regular budget for each year by the end of January of that year.


The Philippines favours a revision of the scale of assessments for United Nations contributions so as to reflect current political and economic circumstances. However, logic and consistency dictate that similar adjustments be made in the shares of the countries affected in the capitalization of the international financial institutions, including the World Bank and regional development banks such as the Asian Development Bank. The worlds peace, stability and progress, and the welfare and dignity of its inhabitants, depend in large measure on the United Nations  not on the Secretary- General or the Secretariat alone. Although their role is crucial, they depend above all on us, the Member States, which, together with our peoples, make up the United Nations. We are the United Nations. Let us make it work."	1996-10-02
Domingo L. Siazon Jr.	UNGA 52	"I am pleased to extend to you, Sir, on behalf of my delegation, our most sincere felicitations on your election to the presidency of the fifty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly.


We also wish to congratulate His Excellency Tan Sri Razali Ismail, our colleague in the Assembly and our partner in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), for his strong leadership as the President of the fifty-first session.


We take great pleasure in congratulating His Excellency Secretary-General Kofi Annan. We commit ourselves to working with him for the improvement of our Organization.


Next year the Philippines will commemorate the centenary of its proclamation of independence. Next year also the Philippines is scheduled to conduct the most sacred exercise that democracy requires: electing national leaders through the popular will. As we mark our first century as the first Republic to arise in Asia, and as we prepare to choose those who will lead our country into the twenty-first century, we reflect on what we have achieved as a country and as a member of our community of nations. Today peace reigns in my country. Where there was strife, there is now national reconciliation. Where there was violent rebellion, there is now progress and hope.


Last year, with the wisdom and guidance of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), in particular the OICs Committee of Six, under the enlightened leadership of Indonesia and with the active support of Libya, the Philippine Government and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) concluded a historic agreement that brought peace to Mindanao after more than a quarter century of open secessionist rebellion. The leader of the MNLF is now the elected Governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao and Chairman of the Southern Philippines Council for Peace and Development. MNLF fighters are now being integrated into the armed forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police.


Indeed, there is much for us to celebrate as a nation and as a Republic. And this gives us even greater reason to reflect on the world and to ask ourselves fundamental questions about its present state and its emerging future. One such question that comes to mind is this: Is our world a safer place? The end of the cold war has in a sense made it so. But is the world safe enough when we continue to live under the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction? Fortunately, the conclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty last year and the ongoing review of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons give us some added security.


We must not stop here. Let us pursue negotiations on the complete and total elimination of nuclear weapons by a certain time. This call is already supported by the International Court of Justice, which last year recognized that all States have an obligation to pursue such negotiations in good faith.


On 27 March 1997 the South-East Asia Nuclear- Weapon-Free Zone Treaty entered into force. On that day, the world of nuclear weapons became much smaller. We now urge the nuclear-weapon States to support the Treaty by becoming parties to its Protocol. At this session we will once again consider the initiative of consolidating existing nuclear-weapon-free zones and of promoting cooperation among them with a view to the total elimination of such weapons.


Global safety also demands control of the proliferation of conventional arms, particularly small arms and anti-personnel landmines, whether deployed or in national stockpiles. In Oslo earlier this month the Ottawa process produced, after less than a year, the text of a treaty banning anti-personnel landmines. We will sign this treaty in December. We will also continue to support the noble efforts of the Organization, of individual Governments and of non-governmental organizations to clear minefields, to assist mine victims and to rehabilitate areas plagued by these infernal devices.


At the dawn of the post-cold-war era, we must acknowledge that the potential for the most serious conflict has shifted almost entirely from the global to the regional level. In the Asia-Pacific region, the Association of South-East Asian Nations, in response to this new reality, has led in creating the ASEAN Regional Forum, a ministerial-level, multilateral forum for promoting regional-security dialogue and cooperation. Today in the Asia-Pacific region dialogue and cooperation are the preeminent modes for securing peace.


However, the disputes in the South China Sea remain a source of tension for our region. In 1992, ASEAN issued, at Manila, a Declaration on the South China Sea, which called for the settlement of disputes exclusively by peaceful means and for the exercise of self-restraint by all of the claimants. Other States have endorsed this Declaration. We are determined to advance towards a settlement of these disputes in conformity with international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, while avoiding all acts inimical to stability and a sense of security in the region.


Like many here, we were saddened by the recent events in the political life of Cambodia. We in ASEAN have initiated a dialogue to address the Cambodian issue, even as we look forward to the early admission of Cambodia into the ASEAN family.


On the Korean peninsula, we hope that the current talks will lead not only to large dividends of peace but also to greater cooperation towards economic growth and progress for East Asia.


In South Africa, following the collapse of apartheid, we are witnessing bold and sincere efforts towards deeper national reconciliation. In other parts of Africa we see active regional cooperation to promote peace and justice in the aftermath of terrible conflicts. In Liberia, in particular, we welcome the holding of free and fair elections with the support of the international community, led by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). In the Middle East, peace is gravely imperilled by terrorism and political aggression. We call on all parties to renounce all forms of violence and intimidation to preserve the peace process that was begun only a few years ago to the applause of the whole world.


In Bosnia and Herzegovina, where much remains to be done, we regret the deterioration of civil order and condemn the violence directed against United Nations personnel.


In Latin America, we welcome the honourable termination of the civil war that had raged in Guatemala for 36 years.


Is the world a safer place for the world itself? The environment of our planet is under threat. Our response must be to accelerate implementation of Agenda 21 in line with the programme adopted last June. As a priority, we must address the lack of financial resources, technology, know-how and international cooperation that inhibits the promotion of worldwide sustainable development. This December we will meet again to discuss a legally binding instrument under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to control harmful emissions. We must agree now on emission reduction targets, particularly for those who have emitted too much for far too long.


How safe, we should also ask, is the world for the individual human being? We can answer positively only when it becomes universally accepted that every human being has rights inherent in his or her person, and that all basic rights  political, civil, social and economic  must be in balanced harmony with one another. Thus, as long as human rights are violated, as long as the right to development is vitiated, as long as the rights of women are not fully respected, as long as people are traded like chattels, as long as migrant workers, especially women migrant workers, are abused and exploited, we cannot say that the world is a safer place for the individual human person.


We must protect our women. We must act on the decisions we reached in Beijing, and we must do more to deepen and broaden respect for the rights of women through the use of existing human rights agreements and mechanisms.


We must protect our children. We must effectively implement the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and we must append to this Convention a protocol that would organize global measures against child slavery, prostitution and pornography.


In addition, we call for universal adherence to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.


The protection of human rights finds its most effective guarantees in democracy. Any threat to democracy also poses a direct and indirect threat to the rights of the human person. Today, in many countries, including my own, democracy is no longer endangered by the extreme political left or right. Rather, the threats to democracy are more base and more insidious. Among them are terrorism and the illicit traffic in narcotics.


With the objective of creating a regional consensus on how best to address the issue of illicit drugs and other transnational crimes, the Philippines will next year host the regional ministerial meeting for Asia and the Pacific on organized transnational crime and corruption. For this meeting, we hope to take inspiration from and add to the consensus achieved in the regional meetings held in Africa and Latin America.


Our efforts to make the world a safer place, and to safeguard the rights of the individual, would lose much of their meaning if we were unable to answer the basic question: have the opportunities for growth and economic progress improved?


The rising tide of globalization has brought unprecedented opportunities for the developed and developing worlds alike. The acceptance of market-oriented development and of free trade by an increasing number of developing nations has expanded their participation in the growth and commerce of the global economy. Yet the benefits of globalization remain unevenly distributed. Developing countries still suffer from the old problems of external debt and of protectionism in developed-country markets.


The recent currency turbulence in East Asia, the region with the best long-term growth prospects in the world, is a sobering reminder that globalization can cause instability even where it has generated the greatest growth. The existence of unbridled international speculation and of other market ills that hinder rather than help development is a powerful rationale for strengthening the United Nations role in global development.


Only in the United Nations can we work to share, among rich and poor nations alike, the burden of structural adjustment imposed by globalization. Only within the United Nations system can we mobilize concerted global action to support progress in the poor regions of the globe, particularly in Africa, whose needs call for special attention.


The Bretton Woods system and the multilateral development banks also need reform. Global flows of multilateral development financing have to be increased, especially since bilateral official development assistance is declining.


Countries that wish to reduce their share in the financing of the United Nations should be willing to do the same in international financial institutions, so that those that want to increase their contributions to these institutions are able to do so without hindrance.


Another fundamental question we must ask is: are we ready, as an Organization of States, as nations united, to face the challenges of tomorrow? The short answer is No. For this reason, the Philippines strongly believes that we must immediately embark upon the reform of the United Nations. We need to enhance the capacity of the world body to meet the exigencies of modern times. A fundamental objective of reform should be to restore development to the centre of the United Nations agenda.


The Philippines, therefore, endorses the recommendations of the Open-ended High Level Working Group on the Strengthening of the United Nations System. If properly implemented, they could render the General Assembly more effective in fulfilling its Charter responsibilities.


Our Secretary-General has given us a report on his own reform proposals. These deserve the serious consideration of the General Assembly. We appreciate the emphasis placed by the Secretary-General on development.


We also need to accelerate discussions on the reform of the Security Council. In this regard, we welcome the progress that has been made in clarifying and identifying the elements that must be negotiated if we are to move towards any expansion of the membership of the Council.


The Philippines favours the enlargement of the membership of the Council in order to enhance its efficiency and effectiveness. Security Council membership should be more representative of the worlds developing regions and more reflective of modern global realities. New permanent members should enjoy the same rights as current permanent members. The use of the veto should be limited to actions under Chapter VII of the Charter. Talking of reform is good. But our talk will lead nowhere if our Organization does not have the resources required to improve and revitalize itself. We survived the balance of terror of the cold war. Let us now work on balancing our cheque-books in the post-cold-war era. There is much irony in this. The end of the cold war should also have meant an end to the astronomical finances spent on deterrence. It might have been reasonable to expect that a fraction of those finances could now be shared to help the United Nations promote world peace, progress and prosperity.


Yet this is obviously not the case. The Secretary- Generals proposed revolving credit fund of $1 billion, to be financed though voluntary contributions or other means  if it materializes  may provide temporary relief. However, there is a real danger that this proposal will encourage those in arrears to delay further their payments to the Organization.


The Philippines is in favour of reform. But reforming the United Nations should not be seen as an opportunity to hold our Organization to ransom. We are all in favour of reforming and strengthening the United Nations. But setting benchmarks of reform should not be a precondition for a Member State to pay its assessed contributions.


In the 100 years since my country declared its independence, war and occupation, dictatorship and partisan politics have at one time or another endangered our democracy. And in those eventful 100 years, we have cultivated certain insights that might prove relevant to us here today. We have learned, as a country, that we must cherish the ideals of democracy in all aspects of our national life, including in our dealings with other nations.


After my people emerged victorious in our last major battle with forces opposed to democracy over a decade ago, we resolved to share our experience with the rest of the world. Thus, we organized in Manila the first meeting of the International Conference of New or Restored Democracies (ICNRD) in 1988. From the 13 nations that first met in Manila, ICNRD has grown to 76 countries today. I congratulate Romania for its successful hosting of ICNRDs third meeting earlier this month.


Given the diversity of the membership of our Organization, it is not surprising that we may have some differences even on such fundamental issues as international peace, global development and the protection of the individual. However, I submit that, if our Organization is to function properly and if Member States are to relate to each other in an effective manner, then we must all follow certain basic principles and ideals. These principles and ideals are those that democracy has taught us. Let us work together with all the creative energy at our command and with the ideals of democracy as our guiding light."	1997-09-29
Domingo L. Siazon Jr.	UNGA 53	"The next speaker is the Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the Philippines, His Excellency Mr. Domingo Siazon, on whom I now call. Mr. Siazon (Philippines): I am pleased, on behalf of my delegation, to extend to Mr. Opertti our warmest congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session.


Just three months ago, the Philippines commemorated the centennial of the birth of Asias first Republic. A month before that the Filipino people conducted the most sacred rite of a democracy: the election of national leaders by popular will. The successful electoral process resulted in the second peaceful transfer of power since our people power revolution of 1986. President Joseph Ejercito Estrada, with a resounding mandate from the Filipino people, has taken over the task of leading the Philippines into its second century as a free and democratic nation. But he does so at a very trying time; he must steer the ship of state on very turbulent waters, with global forecasts painting a picture of even more stormy weather ahead.


And the Asian economic crisis rolls on; it is no longer just Asian nor entirely economic. It will wreak havoc anywhere and spare no one. It has already hit the Philippines hard, though perhaps not as badly as some other countries. Yet, for us, the only tenable direction to go is forward; to go back is to founder. Thus, the Estrada Administrations economic policy will remain marketfriendly, even as it is pro-poor and pro-business. The Philippines will keep the momentum of economic reform and strengthen in particular its financial and banking sectors.


Like all other States, the Philippines pursues foreign policy to promote national security and development. But we view national security beyond the traditional concerns of sovereignty and territorial integrity. For in a global regime characterized by evolving multipolarity of political and military power and by growing economic and financial interdependence, with all their attendant opportunities and risks, my nations peace and prosperity increasingly depend on stability and growth abroad. As President Estrada has said, our way of life, our fundamental values and our institutions can flourish and find true expression only if we enjoy political stability, economic solidarity, sociocultural cohesion, moral consensus and ecological balance, at home as well as with our partners in the world. Our national security and development demand that we actively advance the internationally shared goals of freedom, openness, peace, prosperity and justice.


It is in this context that the Philippines regards the United Nations, which it helped found 53 years ago, as a most important partner in our efforts to promote our own national security and development.


Our part of the world, the Asia-Pacific region, is the scene of growing regional cooperation coexisting side by side with regional tensions. The Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has not only increased its membership but has also expanded its work from the purely economic and social to the security and political fields. It took the lead in creating the ASEAN Regional Forum  the only regional security dialogue mechanism that brings together all the Powers with a stake in peace and stability in East Asia and the Western Pacific. The Philippines hosted the fifth ASEAN Regional Forum last July and is gratified with the growing trust and confidence among Forum participants and with the progress in the promotion of greater transparency and mutual understanding in the region.


Nevertheless, the Asia-Pacific region is not tensionfree. Territorial disputes and issues left over from the Second World War fester. The Philippines hopes that as the new millennium dawns meaningful action towards the resolution of such issues will commence in earnest among the countries concerned.


Peace in the Korean peninsula is essential. The Philippines supports ongoing efforts, including those of the Four-Party Talks and of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO), to build the foundations of peace in the Korean peninsula. Peace in the South China Sea is crucial to peace and prosperity in East Asia. The Philippines encourages all parties concerned to scrupulously observe the principles contained in the ASEAN Declaration on the South China Sea of 1992.


The ratification of the Treaty establishing the African Economic Community augurs well for Africa. The efforts at conflict resolution and prevention by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and subregional organizations such as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), deserve to be lauded.


Nonetheless, one cannot escape the fact that the more intense of todays conflicts have occurred in Africa. The tragic events in Rwanda, in Burundi, between Ethiopia and Eritrea, in Sierra Leone and now in the Congo are familiar to us all. Although these States are responsible for their future, the recurring and protracted conflicts in Africa demand a multilateral response to the political, economic and social ills of the region, and the need to address development issues is paramount. We also cannot afford to ignore the humanitarian disasters such as those in the Sudan. Indeed, political stability is required in Africa, but so is aid. Let no one in this Hall forget Africa and our collective duty to alleviate human suffering there.


The Philippines firmly hopes that the Middle East peace process will resume in earnest and encompass all relevant parties. We reaffirm the need to achieve a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East. The growing number of signatures to and ratifications of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the review of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) raised hopes that nuclear weapons were becoming obsolete. Unfortunately, the nuclearweapon States have yet to live up to their NPT commitments. Moreover, the recent nuclear tests in South Asia were a destabilizing development.


The proliferation of missile technology and capability is just as fraught with danger, if not more dangerous, than the spread of nuclear weapons. These two make for a deadly combination for everyone; both must be stopped. So, too, must the continuing development and stockpiling of other weapons of mass destruction cease. Likewise, we need to put an end to the unregulated transfer and indiscriminate and often illegal circulation of small arms and light weapons.


The Philippines is also deeply committed to the banning and destruction of anti-personnel landmines. My Government is deeply gratified that our common intense effort to conclude the Convention on anti-personnel mines succeeded last December. We strongly urge States that have not yet done so to sign the Convention. We urge all to assist in landmine clearance and the rehabilitation of landmine victims.


Political instability and the collapse of peace and order in any State produce deleterious effects, including security threats for others. For this reason, the Philippines contributes where it can to the establishment or restoration of political stability in other lands, particularly in support of democracy.


Cambodias recently held elections have been judged free and fair. But, as recent developments in that country show, democratic elections, while necessary, are not a sufficient condition for democracy or for peace and stability. Cooperation by all Cambodian parties, prompted by a deeper love for the nations good, is required.


The efforts of the ASEAN troika, the Friends of Cambodia and the United Nations have not been in vain; they have just not been enough. Much could be done by the international community; but so much more needs to be done by the Cambodians themselves to pull their country back from the brink.


The Philippines hopes to see a fully stable South- East Asia, where all peoples enjoy peace and national reconciliation. We hope to see all 10 countries in the region working together for a united and outward-looking South-East Asia, bonded in a partnership of dynamic development and in a community of caring societies. Thus, we are committed to assisting Myanmar and Laos in their integration into a peaceful, prosperous, humane and just ASEAN.


Peace and order are threatened by the evils of terrorism and transnational crime. Terrorism is a crime against humanity, and we strongly condemn it. Transnational crime in all its guises, including drugtrafficking, trafficking in women and children, and moneylaundering, must be stopped. The Philippines joins the rest of the international community in hailing the adoption of the Rome statute of the International Criminal Court. I wish to convey my Governments serious intention to consider the matter of accession to that treaty in the near future.


The world needs economic solidarity. And the Asian crisis, which has spread to other regions, is our immediate global concern. For in its wake, millions of lives have been afflicted, with untold suffering. In its path, nations may fall. The Bretton Woods institutions have played a vital role in the global economy. But it is now clear that their methods and their resources, particularly those of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), are sorely insufficient to contain the crisis and to restore the health of afflicted economies. We need to replenish IMF resources, augment the funds of the World Bank and the regional banks, and develop new remedies for the new problems of a globalized economy.


The United Nations can play a significant role in fostering international cooperation and action to solve the global crisis and mitigate its effects. Together, we can fight protectionism. The suffering spawned by the crisis must be addressed. The significant decline in official development assistance from donor countries needs to be reversed. Now more than ever, social amelioration programmes and safety nets must be enhanced.


The crisis has forced us, too, to focus attention on the quality of governance. The issues of corruption and cronyism have been catapulted to the top of national debates. The ensuing convergence of ideas and resolve towards greater transparency and a more level playing field, at home and throughout the world, should be boons to our peoples and nations.


The financial crisis has also confronted us with the reality that the world is dealing with a new phenomenon. This is the phenomenon of massive amounts of capital flowing across national borders at lightning speed, bloating economies into fragile bubbles as they rush in and shaking economies to their foundations as they are withdrawn. This is one aspect of globalization that carries great peril. It requires much diligent study and delicate handling.


We have long recognized the need to recast the global trading regime and make it more responsive to the requirements of our time. Our efforts on this are well advanced. Now we must begin the work on the global financial system. Together, we must plan and build a new architecture that best suits todays and tomorrows needs. The Philippines welcomes President Clintons eightpoint agenda to lead the world out of the current global economic and financial instability. Real action is what the world, not just Asia, needs urgently. Indeed, threatening clouds are overhead. Lives are needlessly shattered. We need to limit the damage now and start rebuilding as soon as we can.


Another lesson the crisis teaches us is about how brittle and fleeting high growth in gross domestic product is. It is not difficult to associate the roots of civil unrest in the wake of economic hardships with the lack of social justice on the ground. The poor, who get hit first and hardest in any economic downturn, will always be restive if development yields dividends only for the rich. The crisis makes us realize that the fruits of prosperity and the pains of sacrifice must be enjoyed or borne equitably. The globalization of information and the media may have reduced cultural barriers to the point of homogenizing certain cultural aspects of life. But the world continues to suffer from cultural intolerance. The plight of children, the rights and advancement of women and human rights in general still need to be addressed vigorously by the international community. The continuing exploitation of children for pornography, prostitution and drug-trafficking, not to mention the suffering of displaced and refugee children, is a global problem. The Convention on the Rights of the Child should guide international action in this area. At the regional level, the Philippines and the United Kingdom, under the aegis of the Asia-Europe Meeting, have launched a joint initiative on child welfare with a view to creating a better international cooperation mechanism on this endeavour.


The Philippines attaches great importance to the promotion and protection of the rights of migrant workers and their families, and we continue to call upon all countries to accede to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.


All human rights  political, civil, social and economic are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated. So long as any or all of these rights are not respected globally, we cannot rest, even as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For the Philippines, the best and surest way to promote social justice and human rights is through a sincere commitment to the rule of law. And one law that is selfevident and immutable in all cultures is the sanctity of human life and the dignity of the human person. Many of the international commitments made at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, particularly Agenda 21, remain unfulfilled. And sadly, no new or additional resources needed by developing countries to implement many of the actions agreed at the Summit have materialized. We appeal for early action on these points.


Sustainable development continues to be an important focus of Philippine foreign policy. As Chair of the sixth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development, the Philippines emphasized the role of civil society in the implementation of cooperative activities in key areas such as freshwater resources, the role of industry, technology transfer and capacity-building in development.


Last April, the Philippines signed the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We join other States parties to the Convention in urging the speedy entry into force of that Protocol. Addressing global challenges and problems requires international action and cooperation. The United Nations remains the principal multilateral forum for the initiation of such action and cooperation. As a founding member, the Philippines recognizes that the United Nations must have the active support of all its Members and adequate resources in order to be effective. We have supported the various reform exercises undertaken in the past years, and we will continue to do so, to ensure the continued relevance of this our reliable partner.


Inasmuch as the overwhelming majority of United Nations members are from the developing world, the United Nations reform process must restore development issues to the core of the United Nations agenda. It should also enable the General Assembly to fulfil effectively its Chartermandated responsibilities.


There is a pressing need to modernize and reform the Security Council. The Council is the United Nations organ with the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security, and its decisions must be viewed as serving the collective interest of all United Nations Members. Thus, its membership must be enlarged to include more key global players and developing countries. Its working methods and decision-making processes should become more transparent and democratic.


As a democracy, the Philippines is convinced that global efforts and cooperation to achieve peace, prosperity and development can succeed only if democracy thrives within nations and serves as the basis for relations between and among them. At the global level, this requires respect for the principle of sovereign equality among States, the commitment to enrich, not beggar, one another, the need to uphold and defend the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law, the pacific settlement of disputes, the promotion of all human rights, and respect for the one and only world we live in. Without exception, all nations need to cooperate and be part of the solution to all the worlds woes. For we are all in this together, and there are no others to blame. As Shakespeare admonished, The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, But in ourselves, that we are underlings (Julius Caesar, Act I, scene 2)."	1998-09-28
Domingo L. Siazon Jr.	UNGA 54	"Mr. President, I would like to congratulate you as you take on the honour and responsibility of leading the Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. Allow me to express our deep appreciation to His Excellency Minister Didier Opertti, who led us last year with admirable efficiency, insight and, on occasion, good humour. I take this opportunity also to commend the Secretary-General for his dedication and inspiring leadership in the service of our Organization.


I would also like to welcome Presidents Teburoro Tito, Rene Harris and King Taufaahau Tupou IV, their delegations and the people of Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga, all fellow members of the Asia-Pacific family, to the United Nations. Their membership in our Organization should further bolster the global consensus on peace and progress in the world.


Almost a decade ago the cold war ended and we are today at the doorstep of a new century. Over those years, we achieved much as individual nations and as Members of this Organization. Yet, our collective search for peace and progress for all continues. After many years of eloquent debates, after hearing many persuasive proposals and formulations, how well indeed have we mastered the language of peace. But the wars and strife that afflict our world, even as we speak, show that we have neither fully learned nor lived the ways of peace. As at its founding, our Organization is faced with the dire spectre of countless multitudes living in utter dread and misery. The much-touted new global order, where nations live in harmony and peace, where growth and sustainable development are rights and not privileges and where justice rules and human rights are upheld remains a promise. We encounter newer threats to the peace, and old threats are re-emerging. Poverty stalks many lands. Far too many people have their human rights ignored or violated. Our very Earth protests decades of unbridled abuse.


One of the clear victors at the end of the cold war was the free market. For most of our lives, the assault upon the very idea and practice of the free market came from an ideology. Today, even that ideology embraces the methods, if not the spirit, of the free market. It now seems that the growing reach of the free market, or globalization, is held back only by our inability to adapt to it fast enough.


For so many years, East Asia was admired for its success with globalization. The so-called East Asian miracle was little more than our regions economic response to it. Our fast growth doubled our incomes and moved tens of millions of our people out of poverty. Up until July 1997, we thought all was well.


Now we know better; we have learned our lessons. Our difficulties could have been less severe or avoided with better public and corporate governance, with better management of financial systems, with greater transparency and accountability; in other words, with greater openness, which is the heart and spirit of the free market or any truly free system.


Happily, the crisis did not destroy the conditions underpinning East Asias growth formula of outward-oriented industrialization. A propensity for high savings, abundant highly educated human resources, higher productivity and economic reform policies remain.


Today, East Asia is on the road to recovery. Consumer confidence is rising. Exports are booming. Inflation has been tamed. Investors are coming back. Japan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia are all growing again. The Philippine economy will grow by more than 3 percent this year and over 5 percent next year. Yet, there is no retreat on our core reform agenda. Economic restructurings continue. Greater economic integration goes on. The Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, for instance, took extraordinary steps to underscore their commitment to free trade and investment. During its Hanoi summit last year, ASEAN resolved to accelerate, not retard, the establishment of the ASEAN free trade area to the year 2002. We are accelerating the implementation of the ASEAN Investment Area and ASEAN Industrial Cooperation schemes. We have also moved towards greater financial cooperation by establishing at the Asian Development Bank a regional economic monitoring and surveillance mechanism. It should encourage transparency, institute better coordination of economic policies and help ward off future financial crises. However, internal reforms cannot be enough. The crisis also exposed the weaknesses lurking in the international system. Realizing early on that the phenomenon of globalization should be addressed multilaterally, the United Nations has sought the cooperation of other multilateral organizations to strengthen normative, legal and institutional frameworks in the hope that the global economy can be managed more effectively and, perhaps more importantly, more equitably. For the yawning gap between poor and rich nations continues to widen, and the pace and level of development of countries are, alas, more uneven.


In a fast-globalizing and interdependent world, augmenting the ability of developing countries to participate fully in the global economy is the win-win solution for all. Insecure market access, high levels of protection and support of agriculture in industrialized countries and the continued high tariffs on industrial products from developing countries obviate greater progress for all.


The international trading system must adopt a new paradigm in which sustainable development should be the central theme. The World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference to be held in Seattle late this year should be not only an opportunity to launch a new round of multilateral trade negotiations. It should also be an occasion to imbue the process with a sense of direction that responds to the development needs of developing countries.


The global financial architecture must be strengthened. There is urgent need, as the Committee for Development Policy pointed out in its 1998 report to the Economic and Social Council, for the coherent development and effective monitoring of international standards and codes of conduct for private financial management and capital flows. There is also need to curb destructive competition and inconsistency in national regulatory frameworks.


More and more, countries and regions need to reach out to one another in the spirit of cooperation and partnership for development. The ten-year-old Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council, or APEC, is founded on this conviction. So is the much younger Asia-Europe Meeting, or ASEM. And it heartens us that the East Asia-Latin America Forum, having recently taken its first steps, may soon join in the more sustained and structured effort to link up for global progress. The Philippines anticipates a similar region-to-region initiative with Africa and will contribute its utmost to any such initiative.


From a historical perspective, we are still at the very early stage of globalization. With globalization having the potential to grow exponentially, as do the revolutions in technology and information that fuel it, this early stage is perhaps the most critical one. Only earnest international cooperation can ensure that this process does not lead to the marginalization of any nation.


But, as our recent experience in East Asia shows, economic progress alone cannot and does not engender the optimal well-being of nations or peoples. Progress in ensuring political stability and security should accompany growth. Any asymmetry in the pace, breadth and depth of change in these facets of the political economy is a seed of future instability. Moreover, just as our economic prospects are determined by our participation in the global economy, our future peace and security will depend not only on our internal resilience, but also on the active cooperation of others.


In East Asia the most urgent undertaking for ensuring peace is the reconfiguration of the strategic security structure in the region. The holes left gaping by the end of the cold war must be filled; the new parameters of the regional security equation must be defined. The situation in the Taiwan Strait is a concern to us all. So are the issues of missile development in the Korean peninsula and nuclear development and uneasy peace in South Asia. The South China Sea remains a potential flashpoint. We are hopeful that, in addition to measures advancing regional economic and financial cooperation, a regional code of conduct in the South China Sea can be adopted at the summit of leaders of ASEAN, China, Japan and the Republic of Korea that we are hosting in Manila in November.


East Asia has clearly not yet settled all its great issues of war and peace. But we are trying hard and succeeding in some important ways. At the sixth ASEAN Regional Forum  the only forum on security that includes all the major Powers with a stake in our region  we agreed to draft rules of procedure by which preventive diplomacy could bolster and complement regional confidence-building measures. Last December we agreed to move closer to the full activation of the ASEAN High Council and the dispute settlement mechanisms mandated by the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia.


The 5 May 1999 Agreement on East Timor and the free, fair and orderly conduct of the 30 August consultations there are truly significant developments for lasting peace in our region. For the Philippines, it is of the utmost importance that the chaos there be quickly resolved and the horrendous human suffering be stanched. We therefore welcome Indonesias decision to invite the assistance of the United Nations and of a multinational force, and its creation of a national commission of inquiry to investigate and bring to justice persons responsible for the atrocities and human rights violations in East Timor. We also commend the Secretary-General and the neighbouring and other countries for responding quickly to restore order and facilitate humanitarian relief in East Timor. As a fraternal neighbour of the peoples of Indonesia and East Timor, we will contribute all we can to ameliorate the humanitarian situation and put back on track a peaceful transition.


Elsewhere, the Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement is a positive development for the Middle East peace process. We are also heartened by the agreements reached recently in Sierra Leone and the Congo, and between Eritrea and Ethiopia. We hope that the resolution of the immediate crisis in Kosovo will soon create the conditions conducive to the establishment of lasting peace there.


It is true that we have avoided major inter-State conflicts of late, and that States are more willing to resolve disputes peacefully. But the continuing tensions in various regions of the world could still draw nations into conflict and divert attention and resources away from development. For the Philippines, regional cooperation provides a key to managing potential and actual conflict situations. We have seen this in the efforts of the ASEAN troika, the United Nations and the international community to restore political stability in Cambodia, and in the dispatch of a multinational force to East Timor with authorization from the Security Council and upon the invitation of the Indonesian Government.


We agree with the Secretary-General that it is necessary and desirable to provide support for regional and subregional arrangements and initiatives on matters of international peace and security. The United Nations, lacking the capacity, resources and expertise to address all issues unique to each region of the world, should complement rather than supplant regional peace efforts. This, however, will require significant investment from all of us. In the first instance, we need to invest a lot of goodwill and build trust in one another so that clearer criteria and a more predictable basis can guide Security Council authorization for all types of peace missions. We realize that no two situations are the same, but inaction due to stalemates in the Council, in the face of serious threats to peace and human life, threatens the credibility, legitimacy and future effectiveness of our Organization.


Secondly, the Organization and its Member States need to invest in practical steps that can be taken in the areas of training assistance, joint peacekeeping exercises, greater participation in standby arrangements, partnerships between countries whose contingents require equipment support and those able to provide it, and closer cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations. And thirdly, perhaps more important, we need to invest our work and way of thinking with greater flexibility and innovation. The nature of conflict has changed. Crises and humanitarian situations now involve many more actors, from Governments and international organizations to non- State players. And their effects, just like their causes, are more complex and far-reaching.


Let us face it, much of what was considered before as the internal affairs of a State is not so any more  or ever. Humanity is indivisible. Peace is indivisible. State sovereignty is important; it will always be. So is individual sovereignty. That the redefinition of one should coincide with the renewed consciousness of the other is, to my delegation, not an accident. These developments need not even be seen as parallel, as in they do not meet; for in truth, they converge.


But we agree with the Secretary-General that the more important question is how the United Nations  the only truly universal, if imperfect, arm of the international community  is to respond to the political, human rights and humanitarian crises affecting so much of the world. We have to be more innovative in our approaches to problems relating to massive and systematic human rights violations. We agree that empowering the United Nations enough to match its Charter mandates in todays and tomorrows world requires that we, the Member States, update our concept of national interest.


Last year, before this Assembly, I articulated Philippine policy, thus:


Like all other States, the Philippines pursues foreign policy to promote national security and development. But we view national security beyond the traditional concerns of sovereignty and territorial integrity. For in a global regime characterized by evolving multipolarity of political and military power and by growing economic and financial interdependence, with all their attendant opportunities and risks, my nations peace and prosperity increasingly depend on stability and growth abroad. As President Estrada has said: Our way of life, our fundamental values and our institutions can flourish and find true expression only if we enjoy political stability, economic solidarity, socio-cultural cohesion, moral consensus and ecological balance, at home and with our partners in the world. Our national security and development [or in short, our national interest] demand that we actively advance the internationally shared goals of freedom, openness, peace, prosperity and justice. (A/53/PV.17, p.6)


After the events of the last year, we are more convinced that the collective interest, our common interest, is my countrys national interest. The need to reform the United Nations is our common interest. Reforms should not only seek to make the United Nations more efficient; they should make it truly responsive to the new demands of international peace, security and development.


The Security Council, with its wide mandate and leadership role, should be at the centre of change and reform itself. It should be truly representative, democratic, transparent and accountable. The use of the veto should be rationalized.


The day may come when we shall have achieved consensus on the reforms that we wish for our Organization. The day may also come  and soon I hope  that the financial morass our Organization is in will have passed.


But while these are critical to the very survival of the United Nations, the continued existence of our Organization would be far more meaningful if we could invest it with a new openness and greater trust. The Philippines believes that to achieve this, we must start at home, in our own regions. We must, in appropriate circumstances, be more open to hearing the views of others and offering our own, even on issues deemed too controversial. A new openness would reflect the boldness with which we should renew the promise of a new era. The United Nations proved its great worth in this century. Its continued success in the next will depend entirely on us, on the goals we hope to achieve with it, on what we are willing to invest in it. After all, we are the United Nations."	1999-10-01
Domingo L. Siazon Jr.	UNGA 55	"The twentieth century was one of great trials and great achievements. The new century will be what we make of it. Whatever has been won in the name of peace, the hunting season in history is not quite over. Tension between nations has not disappeared. Ethnic strife, religious extremism, economic inequity and social injustice continue to fuel conflict. Agents of terror and transnational criminals strike everywhere.


Despite the new wealth of nations, 1.2 billion people live on less than $1 a day. The 32 poorest African countries do not earn much more than the richest man on earth. And, despite the grinding poverty of billions, the world spends $145 per capita on military forces. We must do better  much better  than this.


Our Organization received the needed impetus at last weeks Millennium Summit. That should not be squandered. The fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly must reflect the new global covenant for peace and progress. As always, the United Nations must be at the forefront of this great enterprise. We are here to lead.


The Philippine delegation sees this Millennium Assembly as a bridge to link three divides: those of the past and the future; of experience and vision; and of promise and fulfilment.


Fifty-five years ago our Organization arose from the ashes of war. Some founding Member States were very young, just recently set free from centuries of colonial rule. All were still preoccupied with tasks of rebuilding lives and neighbourhoods shattered by the Great War. The ideological divide was to become deeper and wider. The foundations for the walls and curtains that defined an era were just being laid. For the average person then a truly global community was no more than an ideal, remote and all but removed from the day-to-day lives of mostly rural, agricultural populations.


Now we are all part of the global village. Interdependence is a recognized and accepted fact. Globalization is on the lips of everyone, sometimes with scorn, at other times with affection, but always with the discernment that it is the wave of the future. Above all else, that future belongs to all the worlds people, to both the affluent and the destitute, to both the strong and the weak. With everyones direct involvement in charting and realizing our common destiny, we open the door to the fullest flowering of humanitys potential. We also affirm human dignity.


Wiring the worlds cities into the information grid of the twenty-first century is indeed one wise investment we should be making today. But if anyone were left out, if the digital device were but to echo and perpetuate social injustice on a global scale, we would not have moved far from where we started. The past would simply repeat itself.


To empower people is to build our bridge to the future. The worlds leaders were therefore on the mark when they enshrined freedom, equality, solidarity, tolerance, respect for nature and shared responsibility as the fundamental, people-empowering values of the twenty-first century. Now, it is this Assemblys turn to employ those values and take steps to achieve the specific objectives set by the Summit for people empowerment.


Let us buckle down to work and ensure that by 2015 all children will be able to complete primary schooling and, beyond that date, that they have the opportunities to pursue higher levels of education. For let us face it, education is the best tool for protecting human rights, promoting democracy and advancing good governance.


But because a sound mind will work better in a sound body, let us win the battle against disease, including HIV/AIDS, which lays to waste millions in the worlds poorest regions. Let us take action to drastically reduce maternal and under-five child mortality from their horrendous current rates and to achieve the lofty goals of the Cities Without Slums initiative.


Let us invest in humanity. Let us launch in this Assembly nothing short of a Marshall Plan for the worlds people. Let us build this human bridge to our future, now.


The United Nations has both the experience and the vision needed for success. Our Organization has both the privilege and the duty to lead our world into the future with confidence. We know how to do it. To sustain the United Nations capacity to carry out its tasks, deep institutional reforms must now take place. A more energetic and financially stable world Organization, led by a proactive General Assembly and strengthened by a truly representative and transparent Security Council, must now emerge.


For the new covenant on peace to prosper, the United Nations must remain, without equivocation or doubt, the first and last peacemaker and peacekeeper of the world. It should also be the vanguard that champions the rule of law in international as well as in internal affairs.


Preventive diplomacy must be our principal tool in warding off conflict. We must reduce the use of force. But where we need to use it, as in self-defence or under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, we should be guided by international legal norms and practice.


United Nations peacekeeping operations should be prosecuted with clear and well-defined mandates, adequate resources and strong international support wherever they take place. The report of the Brahimi Panel on United Nations Peace Operations deserves our urgent and careful consideration.


More than ever, the United Nations must now gather together the political will of all nations to bring about the final stage of disarmament and the muchawaited arrival of a nuclear-weapon-free world.


Towards this end, we must support the Secretary- Generals call to convene a conference on nuclear dangers, actively participate in the 2001 small arms conference, negotiate a comprehensive convention against terrorism and progressively improve weapons and arms budget transparency measures.


The central role of the United Nations does not and should not stop at matters of international peace and security. It should also be at the heart of our efforts to promote prosperity for all. It should lead the charge against poverty and the efforts to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people whose income is less than one dollar a day.


Along with the Bretton Woods institutions and other multilateral organizations and fora, the United Nations is well placed to make important contributions to the reform of global economic and financial systems. For our goal is not only to have a borderless world for unfettered trade and investment. We should found a global economic regime that builds productive capacities, not income gaps; that promotes openness, not corruption; that rewards enterprise, not greed. In all these, partnerships with the private sector and with civil society are indispensable. Every man, women and child is our co-stakeholder and partner. For what we are trying to build is a new global order where human security goes beyond mere military security; where law upholds human dignity and both people and State uphold the law; and where political pluralism and cultural diversity are requisite to the attainment of common human objectives.


In other words, peace and prosperity must rest more on human cooperation than on anything else. For in this global village, cooperation is the only tenable way to bridge experience and vision.


The United Nations Millennium Declaration embodies our collective hope: the promise of a true community of nations working together for a more peaceful, prosperous and just world. We know that between this promise and its fulfilment lies a tortuous road, yet we must tread its length. In this journey, the first and most important step we should take is to remove the greatest source of danger and discord, that is, underdevelopment. For if one is not free of want, he cannot be free of fear.


In the developing world, the toll from decades of turmoil and abject underdevelopment has been so debilitating that only international relief can help some of us back to our feet. Many of us may cry for safety nets. But not even fish welcome life inside a net. What we need is a new deal for the poor countries. Development is particularly difficult for countries saddled by mountains of crippling debt. Some 1.6 trillion dollars is now owed by developing countries, several of which have to use up to 95 per cent of their hard currency revenues to service debt. In the meantime, development assistance is declining. This year, grants to developing countries may total 40 billion US dollars  a mere half of what it was a quarter century ago.


As earnest for our collective future, we should have meaningful debt relief for the worlds heavily indebted poor countries immediately. Let us also see the fulfilment of the promises of overseas development assistance (ODA) made three decades ago. Further steps must be taken at the third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries next year. We must ensure its success to help our brothers and sisters in Africa, in landlocked developing countries, in nations particularly vulnerable to natural disasters and in least developed countries in all regions of the world. At this Assembly, we should do our utmost to guarantee that all preparations necessary for the success of this conference are made.


We must also redeem the pledge of our leaders to make every effort to ensure the success of the highlevel international and intergovernmental event on financing for development in 2001. By investing this event with the active participation, goodwill and expertise of all stakeholders, including the private sector, from the preparatory stages to the plans implementation, we may yet achieve what several United Nations Development Decades have not. The worlds people took heart from the boldness of spirit and resolve our leaders expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration. They were reassured that we intend to take the world into the future as partners and not as adversaries. They wished for clear direction from our leaders, and they received it. Now, they look to us in this Millennium Assembly for concrete action. Let us rise to the challenge and build the bridges to peace and prosperity for all the united nations."	2000-09-19
Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo	UNGA 56	"Let me begin by congratulating Your Excellency, Mr. Han Seung-soo, on your election as President of the General Assembly. I am especially gratified to be addressing the Assembly when a distinguished Asian is again at its helm. I congratulate as well His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan on the Nobel Prize that he, together with the United Nations, has received. That prize constitutes recognition by the international community of the indispensable role of the United Nations and of the necessary work it has done on the Secretary-Generals watch towards world peace and justice.


At the most elemental level, we feel most deeply the sad and tragic impact of the recent inhuman acts of terrorism: the lost lives, the orphaned children, the widowed spouses, the parents struck with the unimaginable grief of outliving their children and, worse yet, of watching them die. As we watched the horror unfold, we felt as though it were happening to us  as indeed it was, for the United Nations is in a sense one family. The blow that was struck at this international city of New York was felt as directly by the rest of the world. As people the world over stopped to watch in horror as the twin towers came down, the worlds economies ground to a virtual halt.


Business activity stopped, investments were withdrawn, markets shrank, tourism dried up, more jobs were lost, living standards dropped even further, destitution spread and the very conditions that favour terrorism spread and deepened. Our misgivings about a world slowdown deepened into certainty about a recession that will be felt most deeply by those least able to endure it: not just classes but whole countries. The average growth rate in the gross domestic product of developing countries could fall from last years 5.5 per cent to 2.9 per cent. For most poor countries, that will translate to sub-zero growth.


The face of terrorism that this city saw over a month ago is a familiar one to Asians. It has taken a terrible toll in terms of the lives of our people and the economies of the region. It has destroyed our credit and has deterred investment. It has caused Asian Governments profound embarrassment at being caught flat-footed and unable to offer their citizens the most basic security. In the south-western part of the Philippines, it has taxed our resources and our patience to the limit, for terrorism is the argument of those who are not really interested in reasoning but only in getting whatever they want on their terms alone.


We know terrorism. We are fighting it in the south-western Philippines. The perpetrators of the first attack on the World Trade Center were apprehended by our police. Rather than dismembering our country and dispossessing our people of their homes, we have been negotiating with secessionist groups. But we have thrown the full weight of the law, including the use of force, at those who have resorted to terrorism. We know the enemy, and we know that these are not people you talk to; these are people you fight. As the Secretary-General has pointed out, there are those who will hate and who will kill even if every injustice is ended. You must fight them in the field, when they take to the field and hunt them in cities when they hide inside.


It was in the light of that experience in the southwestern Philippines that we immediately condemned the terrorist attacks on the United States, for we recognized them immediately as desperate and despicable acts by that violent minority which seeks to enslave the world with fear. And indeed, they have given the world good reason to be afraid. The attack on the World Trade Center, which aimed to take the lives of the 50,000 people who worked inside it, shows us an enemy without pity, without compunction and prepared to use any means to achieve the greatest destruction.


The Philippines did not need to join the war on terrorism: it was in that war already, in the southwestern part of our islands. The Philippines could not have done otherwise than to renew its commitment to fight terrorism in a wider field in the wake of 11 September. We know that this is an enemy that must be fought everywhere so that it cannot again strike at will anywhere it pleases.


This is a fight between tolerance and bigotry, between reason and fanaticism, between law and anarchy, between justice and murder pretending to be just. In this fight, there is no side to choose but the one where the civilized nations of the world  long-time allies and former enemies  have chosen to stand united, not least here in this Hall.


The Secretary-General has declared that the 11 September attacks struck at everything our Organization stands for: peace, freedom, tolerance, human rights, and the very idea of a united human family.


I do not know if the future belongs to our side, but I am convinced that there will be no future if our side does not prevail in this fight  at least, no future that any of us would care to live in. In fact, it would not be a future in which most of us would be allowed to live. It would be a future where happiness was suspect, delight was blasphemy, beauty was a cause for shame and independent thought a capital crime.


But while terrorism cannot be placated, and no terrorist should be appeased, there is no doubt in our minds, either, that we must address the concerns that they pretend are the inspiration for their terrible deeds. If the world can show that it will carry on, that it will persevere in creating a stronger, more just, more benevolent and more genuine international community across all lines of religion and race, then terrorism will have failed.


No, terrorism will not stop, but it will have failed. To stop terrorism, the terrorists themselves will have to be stopped. What we can do, however, is to strip them of their moral pretensions and take upon ourselves the causes that they have perverted.


No nation will indefinitely endure the yawning gap between rich and poor  a gap that is only growing bigger, not just within, but across the countries of the world. It is this growing disparity between the ever fewer rich and the ever-increasing poor that has given terrorism the freedom of movement and impunity from accountability that it has enjoyed.


Poverty can be reduced partly by national economic growth. But, more than that, societies have to adopt deliberate policies to ensure that the income levels of the poor rise faster than those of the rich.


Recent developments in the global economy have displayed the perils of overdependence on external markets. We must expand domestic demand and increase the purchasing power of the masses of our people. This is largely the responsibility of each nation. We in the Philippines are addressing the affront of mass poverty through housing, education, lower medical costs, more efficient power, transportation and communications, infrastructure in the countryside, credit to small farmers and micro-industries, productivity, protection of the environment, and development of the areas farthest from our centre of political power and economic activity. The international community also has a responsibility in the elimination of poverty.


Commitments to devote a certain percentage of gross domestic product to official development assistance have a place. But the most effective, and least costly, anti-poverty measure on a global scale is for developed countries to open their markets wider to the products of the developing countries, including in particular those products turned out by poor people in the poor countries  agricultural commodities, textiles, clothing and footwear, as well as electrical and electronic appliances and components.


The global trading system cannot allow developed countries to subsidize heavily their agricultural exports while the developing countries are without the means to help their own farmers.


The recent Ministerial Meeting of the World Trade Organization (WTO) decided to launch a new round of multilateral trade negotiations. To ensure that the WTO does not lose credibility at this crucial time, our top priority is to ensure that the Doha round is truly a development round.


The effort to conquer poverty must embrace all cultures, all ethnic groups and all religious communities. Nations must allow all to preserve their own cultures.


We must make political autonomy accessible to regions that want it. At the same time, no one must be allowed to resort to terrorism to further political aims.


Respect for culture and religion, resources for development, openness to political autonomy within the sovereignty of the nation and rejection of terrorism are the foundations of the Philippine approach to our ethnic diversity and to the uplifting of our Muslim and tribal minorities.


The vision of nations where poverty is rapidly reduced cannot be attained in places where women and girls are mistreated and their rights trampled upon. As a woman head of State, woman head of Government and woman Commander-in-Chief of the worlds fourteenth largest nation, I say: we cannot conquer poverty without liberating women and girls where they are oppressed. The gender gap is a part of the development gap and must be addressed with equal vigour.


The fight against terrorism, the struggle to eliminate poverty, the work on behalf of social and international justice, the strengthening of the rule of law, the promotion of tolerance and mutual respect, the practice of humanitarian compassion, the liberation of women, the never-ending quest for peace  these have long been on the United Nations agenda. We in the Philippines have been doing this in our region, in cooperation with our neighbours.


The heightened virulence of terrorism, the renewed sense of insecurity among the worlds peoples and the alarming slowdown in the global economy have intensified the urgency and importance of our work. Together, let us get on with the job. It is serious. It is essential. It is urgent."	2001-11-16
Blas F. Ople	UNGA 57	"As we welcome our newest members, Switzerland and East Timor, we reaffirm our faith in the United Nations and in the principles of the Charter.


Today, the United Nations faces more challenges and must respond to far more demands than were ever contemplated by its founders. Yet the Organization remains the single most important universal and viable forum for States to interact, for nations to work together and for countries to cooperate in preserving peace, in avoiding conflict and in promoting stability. We believe that Iraq took a step in the right direction when it agreed yesterday to the unconditional return of United Nations weapons inspectors. But the immediate challenge facing the Organization and our world is the looming confrontation that could be brought about by the need for Iraq to comply, totally and unconditionally, with the relevant Security Council resolutions. We credit the diplomatic skills and the sheer determination of Secretary-General Kofi Annan and of the members of the Arab League with this welcome development. We will, therefore, await clear proof of sincerity in action.


But this is just a beginning. We believe that we are far from a true resolution of this issue. We must remain vigilant and must continue to have faith in the Security Council. The Philippines has full confidence in the Council process. We believe that the Council will act in accordance with the imperatives of world peace and security and that it will find the most expeditious and effective way to serve those imperatives.


Consistent with its national interest, and in accordance with its Constitution, the Philippines is prepared to extend political, security and humanitarian assistance to the United States and to the international community in the pursuit of their most vital interest, which coincides with our own vital interests: to defeat terrorism. The case for compliance is compelling. The charges are highly credible and have serious implications for global security. The Security Council should give those charges the most urgent and profound consideration. The international community has put the onus on Iraq to comply with the relevant Council resolutions, especially with regard to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction.


Yet we certainly live in a world of consequences that can be avoided. Poverty, intolerance and inequality provide the breeding ground for terrorism. But we need not make terrorism an unavoidable consequence of those factors. We have learned that in the one year since the shocking and tragic events of 11 September. In that short span of time, we have learned that terrorism cannot defeat us and that it cannot overcome our resolve to fight it, and we have learned the full measure of the bravery of the men and women who stand on the front lines in the war against terror. In that short span of time, we have established new strategic partnerships and have retooled and rearmed existing strategic partnerships. Those partnerships are based on the belief that the world will never be secure unless terrorist lairs are exposed and destroyed and unless terrorist supporters are brought to justice.


In the realm of what is just and what is fair, we know that globalization can contribute to the comprehensive and sustainable development of the developing world. Indeed, in some cases it has done so. But the gap between the rich and poor countries continues to widen.


Let us again remind ourselves of the stark reality that 1.2 billion people live on less than $1 a day; 1.1 billion people lack access to safe and affordable drinking water; and 130 million school-age children, the majority of whom are girls, lack the means to stay in school.


The uneven spread of opportunities for the creation of wealth, and the increasing income inequality within and between countries, have pushed larger numbers of people to the margins of existence. We in the Philippines are building an open economy. We are taking concrete measures to create an open trade and investment environment in our own country and in our region. We have adapted to the realities of globalization, fully aware of the concomitant risks, particularly those that impinge on the well-being of our vulnerable and disadvantaged groups.


We firmly believe that, in general, developing countries accept the need for good governance in their public and corporate sectors. We are continuing our institutional reform, guided by our national priorities, requirements and capabilities. We are taking great pains to restructure our economy, often at high political cost.


Capital is what developing countries lack most in their pursuit of sustainable development. The Food and Agriculture Organization has estimated that an additional annual public investment of $24 billion must be made in poor countries in order to halve the number of hungry people by the United Nations millennium target date of 2015.


Developing countries need more foreign direct investment, particularly in areas that will promote the sustainable use of the environment and sustained growth. We also need improved access to foreign markets.


Many developing countries must also effectively compete in areas where their comparative advantage is great, such as agriculture. However, developing countries do not have the resources to match the subsidies that agricultural producers receive in rich countries, such as the 40 billion euros that European Union farmers receive each year or the additional $170 billion that United States farmers will receive over the next 10 years. We can only wonder what the liberating impact would be on development if the subsidies of 23 cents per dollar for farm goods in the United States or the 36 cents per dollar on farm goods in the European Union were instead invested in developing countries.


We need to reverse the decline in official development assistance, which remains below the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product. But we should also not lose sight of the fact that, aside from increased funding sources for developing countries, the flip side of the development coin should be greater restraint, care and flexibility in the use of conditionalities. Enhanced and effective debt relief, including for middle-income countries, is also needed. Efforts to reform the international financial architecture and to strengthen the development dimension of the global trade and investment regime should be sustained.


Globalization has provided more opportunities and greater choices for people who want to travel the world in search of a livelihood. Some 10 per cent of the people of the Philippines are outside its border. Their safety and welfare is of paramount importance to us, particularly in times of actual or potential conflict. The welfare of migrant workers should be placed higher on the United Nations agenda now, before the migrant issue turns into a serious humanitarian problem. We can start by becoming States parties to the United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.


It is also important for developed nations to support the important work of humanitarian assistance agencies like the International Organization for Migration. Despite the unprecedented wealth created in the last decade of the twentieth century, one out of every five people lives on less than $1 a day. The 32 poorest African countries do not earn much more than the richest man on earth, the title unofficially bestowed upon Bill Gates, the Chairman of Microsoft, in the United States. Despite the grinding poverty in which billions of people live, the world spends incredible sums for military purposes  for armies and weapons of mass annihilation.


Those bent on fomenting hate and violence will find willing adherents, particularly among the helpless, and hopeless poor, the dispossessed and the disenfranchised. The hungry, the young people who do not go to school and those living in the margins of society can become easy prey to the siren songs of terrorists and the perpetrators of violence. Poverty alleviation and development are therefore key strategies in preventing conflict and fighting terrorism. Terrorism has become a major cause of violence and instability in our world. But this is not the only menace to our collective security. Organized crime, environmental degradation and contagious diseases continue to threaten international peace and security.


The proliferation of conventional and non-conventional weapons, including small arms, is continuing. Civil wars and inter-State conflicts remain major causes of instability and underdevelopment. The United Nations must therefore continue to play its important peacekeeping and peacemaking role.


Durable peace and progress with freedom can be achieved only through international partnerships and a renewed faith in the United Nations, which should guarantee meaningful participation by developing countries in global decision-making. The challenges of the world today  potential and actual conflict, terrorism, violence, environmental degradation, organized crime and contagious diseases  recognize no boundaries and affect all.


In the eloquent language of the Philadelphia Declaration of the International Labour Organization, poverty anywhere constitutes a danger to prosperity everywhere. That is the case because humanity  and human destiny  has become a seamless whole. No man is an island, and the bell tolls for us, too. This is the timeless vision of the United Nations, validated by all who have spoken here at the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly. It is a vision and a bond that should unite all nations as we face new dangers and the unmarked frontiers of our collective life on this small, endangered planet. Indeed, the United Nations continues to be the last best hope of mankind."	2002-09-17
Gloria Macapagal Arroyo	UNGA 58	"On behalf of the Philippine delegation I would like to extend warmest congratulations to the President and the members of the Bureau on his election to the leadership of the fifty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly.


The past twelve months have been a most difficult and challenging period for the United Nations. A community of cynicism has formed regarding the ability of the United Nations to rise above the morass of disunity and disruptive competition among major Powers to fulfil its catalytic role in promoting international peace and security and development.


But, while it is undeniable that the United Nations has struggled over the past twelve months, its predicted decline is greatly exaggerated. Economic linkages among nations have widened and deepened in many sectors. The interconnectedness of the global village continues to infringe upon traditional political boundaries. For instance, the tentacles of international terrorism have spread insidiously all over.


These and current developments have displayed that without the centripetal pull provided by international cooperation and partnership through the United Nations, the world would tend to drift apart. The rich would become richer and the poor poorer. Conflict and disharmony would erupt along political, ethnic and even religious fissures. We face the paradox of a world contracting through advancing technology and, at the same time, drifting apart along the seams of inequality.


Three years ago, 146 heads of State and Government and 189 Member States blazed the trail to the future by crafting the Millennium Declaration. In the three years since the millennium started, in the three years since the Millennium Summit, much has been done, though much remains to be accomplished to achieve the goals that the United Nations set for the twenty-first century.


I am pleased to report that the vision of the Millennium Summit and pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals in my country have begun to bear fruit, as they have been applied in our peace process for the southern Philippines, in Mindanao.


The Philippine Government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the Muslim separatist group in the southern Philippines, realize that the prescription of the United Nations is the only correct and viable one: that peace is an indispensable condition for economic development, just as development is an essential component of peace. Nothing will do more to lift the Philippines out of poverty than peace itself. That is why we are negotiating peace with the MILF. The Government of Malaysia has been a prime mover in helping us negotiate peace, and I thank them.


To complement these efforts, the Philippines has launched its bid for observer status in the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). I will be attending the OIC conference next month in Malaysia and hope to use that time to advance the peace process in Mindanao and advance understanding among all faiths. I wish to take this opportunity to thank the United Nations community for its support for the Philippines as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the term 2004-2005, and to ask for your continued support during the elections to the Council.


We wish to contribute our long experience in the United Nations system, as an original founding Member of the Organization. We have actively participated in the Councils initiatives towards the preservation of global peace and security throughout the past six decades, both as a past non-permanent member and as a contributor to United Nations peacekeeping operations and other Council activities. The Philippines has actively contributed military and police personnel to United Nations peacekeeping operations in Africa, Asia, the Americas, the Middle East and Europe over the past half-century. We are now preparing to contribute a contingent to join the latest United Nations operation, the deployment to Liberia next month.


Our guiding principles for our Council participation include the following. The principle of collective security established under the Charter should be observed. The Security Council should maintain and pursue a multilateral approach towards the performance of its primary role of maintaining international peace and security. Observance of the rule of law is of paramount importance in the maintenance of international peace and security.


I believe that there is a strong role for the United Nations to play in Iraq and welcome and encourage United Nations involvement to share the burden with other nations, like the Philippines, that are already participating in the reconstruction of Iraq.


It is heartening that we adopted an important resolution on conflict prevention at the last session of the General Assembly. As long as conflicts occur, there is a need to strengthen our capacities for peacekeeping, peacemaking, and peace-building.


International security, which in recent experience is mostly threatened by imploding and failed States, must be animated by the need to protect individuals and communities from violence. It has also been amply demonstrated that democracy is the condition most conducive to a flourishing rule of law.


Erecting mechanisms and infrastructure for the rule of law should be included as a key part of any exit strategy of United Nations peace operations. It is our view that the Security Council should provide the leadership in moving the United Nations to a stronger commitment to the rule of law in areas where the United Nations is conducting peace operations. Meanwhile, the challenges posed by the global threat of terrorism are being effectively addressed through growing international coordination and cooperation, particularly in the exchange of information, best practices and lessons learned.


We are actively assisting the work of the Security Councils Counter-Terrorism Committee in fighting the spectre of global terrorism, and we are in the process of ratifying the important international conventions on terrorism. At the same time, I am working with other heads of State to ensure continued cooperation in our battle to rid South-East Asia of the threat of terrorism. What is required of us today is to link up once more with the vision that our leaders charted at the Millennium Summit and other recent international conferences, and we should do this under the banner of the United Nations.


The United Nations was created 58 years ago to serve as the multilateral forum of the international community to join hands in confronting challenges. It is sobering to remember that no country, big or small, rich or poor, can feel safe or think that it can remain unaffected by violent conflicts, environmental degradation and human suffering. The United Nations must continue to adapt to changing conditions to fulfil its envisioned role, and we support the call of the Secretary-General for reforms in the structure of the United Nations.


The United Nations is a sui generis global institution that can play a catalytic role to confront all these challenges now and in the future. Therefore, it behoves every Member of this Organization to make the United Nations increasingly relevant and to invigorate it to become a modern, nimble and determined agent for change, which benefits mankind's condition.


We should instil the concept of strength and greatness, not in terms of the ability to achieve or maintain dominance over others, but in terms of the ability of nations to work with others in the interest of the international community as a whole.


We favour the strength of consensus in which the future of world peace, security and prosperity lie."	2003-09-26
Alberto G. Romulo	UNGA 59	"It gives me great pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, as you ably and wisely guide our deliberations at the fifty-ninth session. Allow me also to take this opportunity to express my delegations appreciation to Mr. Julian Hunte of Saint Lucia for his successful stewardship of the work of the fifty-eighth session.


The world has changed a great deal since our hopes and aspirations were enshrined in the Charter almost 60 years ago. What has not changed, but remains unaltered, is our collective desire to build a safe, tolerant and secure world, anchored in justice and social progress.


What has not changed is the very spirit and driving force that brought us together  we, the peoples of the United Nations. Those opening words of the Charter remind us that the United Nations is a creation of the peoples of the world. Those words compel us to recall that our Organization has been entrusted by our peoples with the sacred task of translating their aspirations into reality. They are words that tell us that we are assembled today not only as delegates of our Governments, but also as representatives of our peoples. With those words, the Charter freed the world from the notion that only States matter. With those words, the people were placed at the heart of our United Nations.


Today, the technologies and discoveries that make the world smaller and should bring us together are being used to tear us apart. Today, new forms of political, economic and social division directly threaten our people and the values and dreams they hold dear. These threats have the potential to overwhelm the gains of our Organization and to divide our peoples. All these factors have given rise to clamour for decisive reform in the United Nations. We should start with the basic reform of the structures and relationships that define powers and responsibilities. For our Organization, this means pursuing earnest reforms in the Security Council; the General Assembly and its subsidiary bodies; and the Secretariat. But addressing the most basic elements is also the most difficult thing to do.


Any planned reform of the United Nations should be endorsed by consensus by all 191 Member States. Any reform of the Security Council should give due consideration to the views of the five permanent members, as they will have the final say in the matter.


Any reform should also recognize that a country like Japan deserves to be considered for a seat as a permanent member.


We must all put our creative energies to work, spare no effort and ignore no avenue or opportunity in bringing greater peace and progress to our peoples. Religion and religious leaders have a role to play in fostering tolerance and greater understanding among peoples. They bring unique perspectives to the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Inter-faith dialogue between the peoples of different civilizations should also be encouraged. Deep and historic divisions can be healed through a dialogue between peoples of different faiths and civilizations. The Philippines will work with like-minded delegations in support of efforts to broaden such a dialogue.


Our peoples differences, whether of belief or of culture, should not be a basis for misunderstanding or conflict. But most of all, reform must begin by placing the welfare and interests of the peoples of the world at the forefront our deliberations.


In the 15 minutes that it will take me to deliver my remarks, 60 people will have died of tuberculosis. By the time the curtain falls on a Broadway show, 250 persons, mostly women and children, will have been trafficked into forced servitude or prostitution. By the time we wake up tomorrow morning, 3,000 children will have died of malaria and a further 6,000 children will have perished for lack of clean water.


Instead of having school books in their hands, over 300,000 children in conflict areas have their fingers on the triggers of automatic rifles.


HIV/AIDS kills 3 million people a year; millions of refugees crowd camps. One fifth of the worlds population still live in abject poverty, barely subsisting on less than the price of the newspaper sold around the corner from our hotels.


Terrorism, the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the massive proliferation of small arms directly threaten the people and their livelihood and represent an assault on their dignity.


Critical flashpoints, most of which are in my part of the world, have the potential for armed conflict that would certainly place people and their futures at grave risk.


As a founding Member of the United Nations and as a current member of the Security Council, the Philippines places its faith in the Organization for the maintenance of international peace and security, the promotion of social progress and better standards of life and the protection of the fundamental rights of individuals.


People antedate the evolution of statehood. As we place people at the centre of the United Nations, I would like to highlight the need to protect their lives and the importance of ensuring their livelihood and promoting their dignity.


We must allow our peoples to live free from fear, to live in a safe and secure world. Terrorism poses a serious threat not only to the lives of our people, but also to the values and ideals that define our societies. Terrorism reduces people to mere pawns in a ruthless game of competing beliefs and ideologies.


The rubble in Jakarta has been cleared. Flowers cover the little graves in Beslan. But the enemies of all peoples are still lurking in the shadows, conspiring and plotting, with evil in their hearts and the blood of innocents on their hands.


The Philippines condemns all forms of terrorism. No cause or dogma can ever justify its use. Long before 11 September 2001, the Philippines and its people suffered from the scourge of terrorism. We have seen the face of terror and felt its deadly touch. We were among the first in our region to join the international war against terror. The Philippines believes that conflicts should be addressed before terrorism can begin to define or exploit them. This can be done by working together with other nations.


President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo believes that a new kind of peace has to be developed for a new kind of war, waged by terrorists. She proposes a new global alliance to alleviate poverty and remove it as a breeding ground for resentment and conflict.


With the help of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, violent secessionism has given way to peaceful autonomy in southern Philippines. The potential for terrorism to breed has been drastically reduced. In partnership with Malaysia, we are closer to a negotiated peace with the remaining secessionists, who themselves have renounced terror. With Norway as a facilitator, prospects remain for peace talks with one of the worlds few remaining communist rebel groups.


Another important dimension of human security is economic. At the national level, economic security means primarily providing livelihood for the people. In the Philippines, President Arroyo has enshrined that goal in her 10-point programme of action for 2004 to 2010. The programme calls for the creation of 6 million jobs in six years by giving more opportunities to entrepreneurs, tripling the amount of loans to small and medium-size enterprises and developing 1 million to 2 million hectares of land for agribusiness. If we are to maintain economic security, the international community should also make job creation a priority goal in international economic cooperation. The General Assembly should look more closely at innovative tools that will help spur economic growth, particularly in developing countries. Greater attention should be focused on how micro-credit or microfinance  an area where the Philippines has made significant strides  could serve as an instrument to alleviate the conditions of the poorest of the poor.


Creative ways to solve the lingering debt issue and the spiralling cost of energy should also be considered. We need to ease the burden of debt servicing and to channel those meagre resources to where they are needed most. Each day, developing countries pay the rich nations $717 million in debt service. Every baby born in the developing world already owes $482 at birth. Every year, sub-Saharan Africa pays $10 billion in debt service  four times as much money as the countries in the region spend on health care and education. The wise mobilization of domestic resources, such as remittances for development, should also be carefully studied. Remittances by migrants  much greater than the total amount of overseas development assistance  alleviate the poverty of the family members remaining in their country of origin.


Economic security prospers when the playing field is level for both developed and developing countries. Levelling the economic playing field ensures that the fruits of globalization will benefit the people in terms of better opportunities, more jobs and improved livelihood. International trade, investment and development are crucial tools in raising the peoples standard of living. But the people of poor countries continue to face persistent barriers to their products from the developing world. Those barriers exist despite the strictures of the international trading system, emphasizing the need for an open, rule-based multilateral trading system.


Economic crises in developing countries result in immediate threats to human security. When people do not know where their next meal will come from or when their crops will fail, human security is compromised. In an interlinked global economy, crises spread rapidly. The prevention and mitigation of such crises in developing countries also enhances human security in developed countries. A World Bank study shows, for instance, that the total elimination of agricultural subsidies in rich countries would increase rural income in low- and medium-income countries by about $60 billion a year.


Needless to say, international trade policy needs to be fair, not only to farmers of the developed world, but also to their counterparts in the developing countries. As a start, a substantial reduction in agricultural subsidies for farmers in rich countries would go a long way towards helping their fellow agricultural workers beyond their borders. There is also a need for developed countries to implement their commitments to allocate 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance. Again, official development assistance is an instrument to help people help themselves  a social responsibility that is more pronounced now, in an era of increasing globalization. The inexorable pace of globalization fuels new phenomena and creates new challenges to human security. The fluidity of capital, technology, culture and even people should be acknowledged as inherent to globalization and should be harnessed for the good of the people.


Democracy and freedom  central elements to ensuring the rights and dignity of the people  should be encouraged and promoted, particularly in countries that are in transition or recovering from conflict. It is in that spirit that the Philippines supports the call for the establishment of a democracy fund. The Philippines is prepared to provide technical support and training in the areas of governance, the administration of justice, electoral processes and similar subjects, with third-party support. We will share our knowledge  a result of our own experience as Asias first democracy  since we have had to struggle to regain and preserve that very same democracy.


The world should continue to support the people of Iraq in their valiant effort to create a democratic, free, pluralistic and secure nation. The Philippines stands ready to assist in implementing Security Council resolution 1546 (2004) on Iraq, which was unanimously adopted during our presidency of the Council last June. The United Nations has a significant role to play in Iraq in the political process leading to the elections scheduled for January next year, and it deserves the full support of the international community in its efforts to build a stable and peaceful Iraq.


Conflict has devastating effects on the safety and security of people. The deliberate targeting of innocent civilians as victims is increasingly being used as a weapon of war and as a tool of terrorists. The movement of people across borders reinforces the interdependence of countries, facilitates the transfer of skills and knowledge and stimulates economic growth and development. In order to protect the security of migrants, we must give them the legal status that will enable them to gain access to basic services and will ensure the protection of fundamental rights. The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families entered into force on 1 July 2003. We take this opportunity to call on all our friends to make every effort to accede to the Convention.


The interdependence and interlinkages among the peoples of the world require that human security should top the agendas of local, national, regional and global governance. Human security addresses the challenges of the twenty-first century, responds to our peoples aspirations as enshrined in our Charter and reinvigorates the United Nations in the process. Finally, in a world where people are sometimes reduced to images on a screen and their suffering distilled into pixels and fonts, perhaps we should again be reminded that, when we gave life to the United Nations almost 60 years ago, we ushered in a new era in the human saga, embarking on our historic journey with the words: We the peoples of the United Nations ...."	2004-09-27
Alberto G. Romulo	UNGA 60	"I convey my delegations felicitations on your election, Mr. President, on leading this historic session. I also wish to express our deep appreciation to Ambassador Jean Ping, whose leadership and wisdom proved to be the key to the successful negotiation and adoption of our outcome document.


Sixty years ago, enduring peace was foremost in the minds of the founders of our Organization. Scarred from war and stunned by mankinds capacity for death and destruction, they did not consider failure an option. Our common humanity demanded that we build a better and peaceful world. To do that, representatives from 50 nations gathered in San Francisco, in a building dedicated to those who defended and fought for freedom, to draft a charter that would unite the nations of the world for peace. General Carlos P. Romulo, the head of the Philippine delegation, articulating the hopes of mankind, said then at the United Nations: Let us make this floor the last battlefield.


The leading lights attending the founding of the United Nations are still familiar to us  Joseph Paul Boncour of France, Wellington Koo of China, Andrei Gromyko of Russia, Lord Halifax of the United Kingdom, Edward Stettinius of the United States, His Royal Highness Faisal ibn Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia, Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar of India, Jan Smuts of the Union of South Africa, Jan Masaryk of Czechoslovakia, Herbert Evatt of Australia, Exequiel Padilla of Mexico, and many others. Those visionaries led the historic and daunting task of writing the United Nations Charter.


A third of mankind was still under colonial domination. Only three Asian nations were in attendance. Most of Africa were not yet independent nations. In a forum dominated by colonial Powers, the Philippines fought to ensure the notion that the goal of the Trusteeship Council should not only be selfgovernment but independence.


When the United Nations emblem was being drawn, General Romulo asked that the Philippines, although still a commonwealth, be included. He was told that the Philippines would only be a small dot on that now familiar map. He demanded nevertheless that the dot be placed on the map.


The Philippines insistence on its place on the world map, albeit just a dot, symbolized for many soon-to-be independent and developing nations the challenge facing the United Nations. The clear challenge facing the United Nations at its inception, and particularly developing nations, was to ensure that freedom from want, freedom from fear and freedom to pursue human dignity would be at the heart of the political independence of the States.


Sixty years after San Francisco, we continue to face the challenge of freeing all our peoples from want and from fear and allowing them the true dignity that they deserve as independent nations. The fight for the political and legal independence of States is over, but the fight to win for all peoples their freedom from fear and want and to pursue human dignity continues. For the Philippines, as a developing country, freedom from want is of utmost concern. Poverty, the energy crisis and insufficient financial resources, compounded by debt, are the pressing challenges facing my country and its people. We also face serious security threats, particularly from terrorism  with many of our citizens victimized by terrorist attacks. We recognize the economic and social underpinnings of such acts.


In the not too distant past, my country also had to confront the threat of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Our national experience prompts us to agree with the Secretary-General that these global threats are all interrelated, and our different perceptions of the imminence of the threats facing us should not deter us from cooperating to address them. This brings me to my central theme  that we should let the bond of our broad vision of our common humanity inspire us all to work towards a stronger United Nations for a better world.


We agree with the Secretary-General that no nation can defend itself against threats entirely on its own. We agree that development, freedom from fear and human rights concerns are interrelated and should be equally considered in designing the solutions to the threats we face. We believe that because of this interrelation, these concerns should be addressed in a comprehensive and integrated manner.


The world is facing the problem of unbridled spiralling of oil prices. International cooperation on energy is increasingly becoming an imperative as the capacity and capability of countries, particularly nonoil producing developing countries, to meet their development objectives, including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), are affected. This unavoidably impacts on security.


The Philippines welcomes the 100 per cent debt cancellation for the 38 heavily indebted poor countries. However, the debt situation is expected to worsen, as middle-income countries go deeper in debt with the threat of rising world oil prices. Once more, the need for other innovative and creative means of international cooperation for debt relief also becomes imperative. The Philippines has proposed the consideration of the adoption of a debt conversion scheme including debt-for-equity or debt-for-Millennium Development Goal projects. The scheme calls for the conversion of 50 per cent of the debt service into equity for MDG projects of at least equal value with an income earning potential.


Debt for development projects can focus on areas that would achieve MDG benchmarks such as hospitals and health care, schools, classrooms, information technology, clean water, electricity, reforestation, ecotourism and many others that should help us achieve our MDGs by 2015.


The nexus between development and international migration cannot be overlooked. Migration brings challenges and opportunities to countries of origin, destination and transit. This is another multifaceted issue that requires international cooperation to be addressed in a coordinated and coherent manner. A comprehensive and effective international mechanism for cooperation should be drawn up to address its politico-security, social, cultural and economic development dimensions. As one of the major sending States, the Philippines stands ready to cooperate with all countries in contributing towards the formulation of effective mechanisms that would help ensure a smooth management of the migration phenomenon. The Philippines knows only too well the fear that terrorism instils in the civilian population and the anguish it brings to victims and close relatives. We take cognizance of terrorisms political, social and economic underpinnings.


Our national experience has shown us the value of dialogue in our approach to consider all those factors. The Philippines wants to share this positive value of dialogue and therefore has taken the lead in drawing attention to the need for interfaith dialogue as an integral part for the promotion of the culture of peace. My President recently convened a successful informal summit on interfaith dialogue and cooperation here in the United Nations. The summit adopted a declaration calling for greater interreligious, intercultural and intercivilizational dialogue and cooperation to ensure a lasting and durable peace and understanding at the global, regional and national levels. We invite all who agree with its principles to consider endorsing the declaration.


We all acknowledge that the world has reached an unprecedented stage when there are virtually no more barriers, whether of space or time. Communication technology has made possible the dissemination of information instantaneously to practically all parts and corners of the globe.


As the nineteenth century brought us the industrial revolution, the twentieth century brought us to the technology revolution ushered in by computerization. The twenty-first century now offers infinite possibilities to further advance the information age. At no other time has the saying no man is an island rang truer. As the Secretary-General has said, what affects one affects all in this globalized world. However, the information age is a two-edged sword, as experience has shown us. While it opened opportunities, it also brought challenges that we all have to cope with. Our concern however is that just as the limitless opportunities it offered could be used to benefit humanity, it could also be used destructively. Information technology enables companies to search for lowest cost factors of production globally, operate more efficiently and pass on the benefits to consumers. However, this same technology also enables disillusioned and desperate members of society to become agents of terror and recruit adherents to their way of thinking as well as to fund their destructive activities. It is therefore in our common interest to bring together our collective strengths to take advantage of the opportunities before us as well as to confront common threats.


For 60 years, the United Nations has provided us the forum to draw up norms of conduct that take on board all our concerns. From its inception with 51 Member States in 1945, the membership has almost quadrupled to its present 191 States.


While the United Nations has, time and again, adopted some reforms, at no other time has the pressure for far-reaching change been starker than it is now. The evolving global and regional security environment, ongoing conflicts in many countries that have multidimensional root causes and other flashpoints have to be addressed. It is clear that in pursuing our shared interest to preserve our common humanity, the United Nations continues to serve as our indispensable tool. It is therefore also our shared interest to strengthen it.


Even before San Francisco, some key decisions had already been reached among the major Powers, primarily on the power of the veto, or what was referred to then as the unanimity rule. Our delegation, in concert with others, pressed for an increased role of the General Assembly. We felt that this was the balance necessary to safeguard the effectiveness of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security. We also urged wider and more equitable representation in the Security Council  an aspiration that has yet to achieve realization, and thus an advocacy that my country carries to this day. The outcome document of the High-level Plenary Meeting provides the substance upon which to strengthen the United Nations system. It should guide us well in our discussions on institutional reform. Six decades after San Francisco, our common humanity remains at stake. We have today another opportunity to make our United Nations succeed. Whether the issue is United Nations reform or freedom from want or fear, we must act now to ensure that the principles committed to by our leaders at this years summit be implemented effectively and efficiently. Allow me therefore to present at this point some practical strategies that may assist us in ensuring that we achieve our goals.


Firstly, the agreed commitments should be broken down into tangible steps. Concrete benchmarks and pragmatic indicators of progress must be set.


Secondly, with concrete international benchmarks, national strategies can be geared to achieving them. All concerned national actors in domestic procedures and actions should be involved. This is necessary to put into effect and implement multilateral commitments. Ideally, national actors should be privy to developments in the negotiating process and have the opportunity to provide their own inputs with respect to the national position to be taken. This is expected to ensure implementation and followup to the commitments made by our leaders.


Thirdly, we must not lose sight of the need to increase congruence among national, regional and international plans of action. Keeping these in sight contributes to a faster rate of achieving these goals. National plans of action can be elevated to the regional level, whenever feasible.


Fourthly, we must rethink our existing modes of international cooperation. There will be value in assessing how we have been collaborating bilaterally, regionally and multilaterally. Let us assess the effectiveness of our current modes of cooperation.


In adopting practical measures and in discovering new opportunities and addressing new threats, we must be mindful of the old hopes and enduring dreams that led to the birth of our United Nations. As a child, I listened with all innocence as my family closely followed the work of the Philippine delegation in San Francisco. I felt proud that my nation, the Philippines  the Benjamin among the founders  was part of this historic event.


We were rebuilding our shattered lives and mourning our dead. Yet we held on to hope. We had hope that no country would ever again crush us with their bombs, trample us with their tanks or defile our mothers, sisters and daughters. As a nation devastated by war, we placed great hope in the United Nations. I still remember the words that made us dare dream of a better, more peaceful world  words heard by a child through the crackle and static of an old radio, words spoken by General Carlos P. Romulo in addressing the delegates in San Francisco in 1945. He said: Words are more powerful than guns in the defence of human dignity. Treaties are stronger than armamented boundaries. The only impregnable line is that of human understanding."	2005-09-22
Alberto G. Romulo	UNGA 61	"It gives me great pleasure, Madam, to extend to you the felicitations of my Government and our people, and my own congratulations, on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly. My delegation stands ready to extend to you its fullest cooperation, not only as a member of your Bureau, but as a close friend of Bahrain as well. Your predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, has left an indelible impression on the United Nations. Under his leadership, we were able to carry out a substantial part of the package of reforms mandated by the largest gathering of world leaders, as set out in the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1).


Last year, our leaders met to commemorate 60 years of the United Nations. That meeting gave all of us renewed hopes for peace, growth, progress and the pre-eminence of the rights of all peoples. Those hopes remain, even in the face of continuing threats to the peace and security of mankind posed by terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear weapons; even in the face of grinding poverty and financial uncertainty; even in the face of intolerance and misunderstanding; and, certainly, in the face of the fast-changing nature of our world.


Those hopes remain because the spirit of cooperation and community, which lies at the very heart of our Charter, lives on. Cooperation remains the key to reaching the goals set by our Charter. Cooperation, according to a twentieth-century philosopher, is the only thing that will redeem mankind.


It is in that spirit that the Philippines welcomes and supports the continued work of the Middle East Quartet and its call this week for greater progress towards a just and comprehensive peace. We strongly support the Road Map to peace and maintain our hopes for the realization of the vision of two democratic States, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security.


Together with the other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), we were gravely concerned over the deteriorating situation and the escalation of violence in the Middle East, particularly the disproportionate, indiscriminate and excessive use of force in Lebanon. The United Nations peacekeeping operation now under way in Lebanon renews our hope for peace and offers a great opportunity for the United Nations to demonstrate its relevance and its impact on the world stage. Our own quest for peace in the Philippines is boldly moving forward, thanks to the support and cooperation of key members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and other members of the international community.


Our own experience as a country is convincing proof of the efficacy of collective action in fighting terrorism. Working closely with our neighbours and others, we are ridding our country of terrorists. The recent adoption of the United Nations Global Counter- Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288) will help to strike another blow against terrorists. I commend the Permanent Representatives of Spain and Singapore for having successfully steered the negotiations on the Strategy.


One of the anchors of the Strategy is an initiative that is a primary concern of my country: the promotion of interfaith dialogue and cooperation. In pursuit of that initiative, the Philippines organized and chaired two key meetings held yesterday here at the United Nations: the First Ministerial Meeting on Interfaith Dialogue and Cooperation for Peace and the High-level Conference on Interfaith Cooperation for Peace. As founder and current Chair of the Tripartite Forum on Interfaith Cooperation for Peace  a new movement of Governments, United Nations agencies and religious non-governmental organizations accredited to the United Nations  the Philippines will initiate the holding of another high-level tripartite conference, this time to focus on the issue of small arms and light weapons.


In addition, the Philippines announced last week, at the Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, that we will organize and convene a special ministerial meeting on interfaith dialogue and cooperation for peace in the city of Davao, in southern Philippines. Meanwhile, I commend Spain and Turkey for their new initiative on the Alliance of Civilizations. I believe that it will complement and reinforce, in a mutually inclusive manner, the Philippine initiative on interfaith dialogue and cooperation for peace.


We have barely nine years left to achieve the Millennium Development Goal (MDG), set by our leaders, of cutting poverty in half by 2015. That target could remain a mere vision if no effective mechanism for resource mobilization is found. It is in that context that the Philippine initiative on debt for equity in MDG projects was launched last year; I thank the Group of 77 and China for its support. This initiative does not call for debt cancellation, a debt moratorium or debt reduction; it merely calls for the use of part of the payments from the debt stock of low- and mediumincome developing countries not eligible under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative as equity for creditors in MDG projects in areas such as infrastructure, education, employment and health. Multilateral cooperation in the field of energy security continues to grow in importance. Alternative sources of energy have to be developed. My delegation recommends that the Secretary-General appoint a group of eminent persons to look into this matter. The output of such a group should be the subject of a highlevel dialogue before the current session ends.


One of the historic achievements of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly was the decision to establish the Central Emergency Response Fund for the rapid deployment of relief and assistance to countries stricken by natural disasters. The Philippines ranks third globally in terms of the number of people exposed to earthquakes and tropical cyclones annually. For that reason, the Philippines calls on all nations to support the Fund. We also call for enhanced cooperation aimed at effective responses to natural disasters.


International migration and development was the subject of last weeks High-level Dialogue. That is an issue that is close to our hearts. Approximately one tenth of the population of the Philippines lives overseas. We are the largest supplier of seafarers, and our land-based workers can be found in practically all parts of the world.


Bearing that in mind, the Philippines joined the call for the creation of an informal global forum on migration and development as an outcome of the Highlevel Dialogue, provisionally outside the umbrella of the United Nations, to enable the international community to continue the dialogue on important issues relating to migration. My delegation invites Member States to accede to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families in order to demonstrate and reaffirm the universality of human rights.


For my country and its people, human rights and the sanctity of the life of the individual are of paramount value. For my Government, the protection of human life is a sacred commitment. Last week, the Philippines renewed that commitment through the signing of the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Enshrined in our constitution is powerful language against the death penalty. Three months ago, President Arroyo gave that constitutional mandate further expression when she signed into law Republic Act 9346, which removed the death penalty from our statute books. Such is the value that we assign to life that, in our constitution, we are bound to protect the life of the unborn child. Through the signing of the Second Optional Protocol, the Philippine Government reemphasized its unrelenting commitment to strengthening the protection of human rights.


I should like to take this opportunity to express the profound appreciation of the Philippines and of ASEAN to the outgoing Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, for his dedicated and tireless service to the United Nations. He leaves behind a more invigorated and dynamic Organization, a legacy of reform with new and needed institutions such as the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission, and an eloquent recommitment on the part of the United Nations and its membership to alleviating the plight of the less fortunate through the articulation of the Millennium Development Goals.


The Philippines is particularly appreciative of Secretary-General Kofi Annans support and cooperation during our recent term as a Security Council member during the biennium 2004-2005 and for his steadfast support for the Philippines interfaith dialogue initiative.


Two world wars ago, Mr. Woodrow Wilson, an advocate of a global organization, defined power in terms that are still relevant today. He said: Power consists in ones capacity to link his will with the purpose of others, to lead by reason and a gift of cooperation. The drafters of our Charter and the challenges of the present provide us with the reason. We must now find within ourselves, as nations and as peoples, the gift of cooperation."	2006-09-22
Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo	UNGA 62	"Mr. President, congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly. Congratulations also to our Secretary-General, His Excellency Ban Ki-moon, who was such a good friend of the Philippines when he was Foreign Minister of the Republic of Korea. We embrace his vow to focus on strengthening the three pillars of the United Nations: development, security and human rights.


The United Nations is a pillar of development. It plays a major large role for the Philippines. Poverty alleviation is the most important part of our agenda and our vision of transforming the Philippines into a modernized nation in 20 years. We want to be actively engaged in local, regional and global affairs, because that is the future.


We believe in the power of the global trading system to alleviate poverty and modernize nations through market forces. That does not mean we believe that countries like the Philippines are ready to compete head-to-head today in every sector, but it does mean that we cannot afford to be afraid of globalization. By being increasingly connected to the world, the Philippine economy has reached a new level of maturity and stability, with some of the strongest macroeconomic fundamentals in 20 years. Six years ago, noone thought we could get more revenue, cut down on tax cheats, strengthen the peso and move the stock market. Noone thought we could bring our budget into balance, which we did last month, or prepay our debts and raise employment, but we have. We must both grow our economy and sustain our natural environment at the same time. We are developing and promoting our Green Philippines agenda. It emphasizes a sustainable economic model that brings together economic opportunity and concern for our environment.


At the Secretary-Generals High-level Event on Climate Change earlier this week, United Nations member nations focused on what the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and Kyoto Protocol meetings in Bali to be held in December 2007 should do. The Clean Development Mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol has allowed developing countries such as the Philippines to voluntarily reduce their greenhouse gas emissions through private sector initiatives. But there is a need to expand the carbon market and to expand international cooperation and financial support to promote strategies to adapt to climate change.


Too many nations, both developed and developing, believe the environment must be sacrificed at the altar of growth. We believe otherwise. We believe that we have a unique opportunity to get it right from day one: to introduce new industries that are clean and profitable.


That includes a biofuels industry that helps our energy independence, creates jobs and keeps our nation clean for future generations. We are further developing our geothermal power, which is one of the two largest in the world.


We reiterate our commitment to the global trading system and, when that fails us, to strengthening the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and regional relations in order to bolster our economy. The multilateral trading system, through the Doha Round, remains the best option to address poverty and improve standards of living around the world through an agreed set of international trade rules. The Doha Development Agenda was launched with an emphasis on creating a developmental dimension and integrating it into all elements of the negotiations. To make the Doha Round truly a development round, there must be a greater coherence of policies among international development institutions, such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Trade Organization, so that trade is mainstreamed in the development agenda and capacity-building can be focused on trade competitiveness.


As part of capacity-building, we call on the United Nations and our partners among developed nations to strengthen South-South cooperation, wherein developing nations with specific strengths can share with other developing nations in need of their strengths, funded by developed nations or multilaterals such as UNDP.


The developed nations were the prime movers of global trade when it suited them; now some countries are slowing things down. That is not right, nor is it good for our respective economies. But there has been a ray of hope, with the developed countries declaring that they are willing to maximize flexibilities in exchange for greater market access.


On the sidelines of the current session of the Assembly, we hope the contending countries can continue consulting to find the right formula of subsidy cuts and market access to break the Doha impasse. But let us be clear: even as the Philippines works tirelessly to move the talks forward, we are not going to stand by and do nothing. For us, it is full speed ahead; preferably with Doha, but full speed nevertheless. We recognize that if the multilateral trading system is fragmented into trading blocs, it will result in a more complex set of trade rules. That could incompatible with and detrimental to the interests of developing nations. In the meantime, while we are hoping for a successful conclusion to the Doha Round, we have to maximize the economic opportunities provided under bilateral and regional free trade agreements. That will complement efforts under the multilateral trading system.


At a time of uncertainty, when the Doha Round is faltering, ASEAN has taken a bold step forward by drafting its Charter. That is our first step to creating a permanent sense of community. We are working towards a single market with free movement of goods, ideas and skilled talent.


In APEC, the worlds largest economy, the United States, and the worlds fastest-growing economy, China, are active participants. We have a strong alliance with the United States, which remains our largest trading partner and our strongest strategic ally. We have stood shoulder to shoulder for many generations. We expect to continue building on our mature relationship with the United States. We have also forged a strong relationship with China. Chinas rise is a significant opportunity for the Philippines. Our overall relations are now more confident and comprehensive.


Relations are not just about trade. They are also about people, and this includes migration, a worldwide reality. We thank the Secretary-General for supporting the Philippine hosting of the Global Forum on Migration and Development next year, and we invite all Member States to participate.


Overseas Filipino workers are honoured by the Government and the people for their sacrifice and dedication to work, family and nation. We welcome their contribution, but we are working towards the day when Filipinos no longer need to go abroad for a job, the day that overseas work is just another career option. We believe that our ambitious economic reforms will increasingly keep our best and brightest right in the Philippines, closer to friends and families, helping to build our communities and provide the next generation of leadership.


The United Nations is a pillar of security and human rights. It remains the central pillar underpinning conflict resolution. Our country is among the largest, if not the largest, contributor of police officers to United Nations peacekeeping missions. The Philippines has peacekeepers, both military and police, in Afghanistan, Cte dIvoire, Georgia, Haiti, Kosovo, Liberia, the Sudan and Timor-Leste. We will continue our participation to safeguard communities so that they may overcome conflict and regain the peace needed to pursue development.


Closer to home, I have personally advanced the process of peace in Muslim and Christian Mindanao to a new level of engagement, focusing on interfaith dialogue, economic development and mutual security. We have done so with the largest possible international involvement, including that of the United Nations. Peace in Mindanao is very much an issue of human rights, as is poverty alleviation, our number-one issue. The Philippines is the most democratic country in our region. We have no tolerance for human rights violations at home or abroad. We support the effort to revitalize and refocus the work of the United Nations in human rights. For that reason, the Philippines sought and won a seat on the Human Rights Council.


The attention of the international community has been drawn, with great reason and justification, to the current situation in Myanmar. This is the time for Myanmar to return to the path of democracy, to release Daw Aung San Suu Kyi  now  and to involve all the parties, including the National League for Democracy, in the democratization and constitutional processes.


In conclusion, the number of globe-sized issues we will face in the twenty-first century will require globe-sized cooperation. We must build bridges of peace and prosperity, and the place to start is in building a stronger United Nations."	2007-09-28
Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo	UNGA 63	"The developing world is at a tipping point. In the Philippines, we feel the pain of high prices of food, fuel and rice. Our people pursue the universal dream of a better life for themselves and their children: better education, better health care, higher wages, a dignified retirement. We are proving the value of a new paradigm for self-reliance through the use of, first, a targeted strategy with a set of precise prescriptions to ease our price challenges; secondly, food self-sufficiency and more energy independence; and thirdly, long-term reforms. This is a positive example that we wish to share with the rest of the world.


Our gains over the past seven years were hardearned. We made tough and sometimes painful decisions to reset our economy: tax increases, banking reforms, a crackdown on smugglers and tough fiscal discipline, to name a few. Thankfully, these reforms have given us some running room to weather the first wave of global price shocks that reverberated across the world earlier this year.


It has not been easy, but Filipinos are tough and resilient. We have pulled together. We have been able to draw on additional revenues to provide targeted investments in food and fuel to keep our poor afloat until a better day. But we are also realistic and know that we cannot do it alone. We need a strong United Nations as never before. We need rigorous international cooperation as never before.


Economic uncertainty has moved like a tsunami around the globe, wiping away gains, erasing progress, not just here on Manhattan island, but also in the many islands of the Philippines. Just when we thought the worst had passed, the light at the end of the tunnel became an oncoming train hurtling forward with new shocks to the global financial system. The setbacks from these global shocks of the past year  and of the past weeks  are real and profound. It will take time and perseverance to put the pieces back together. To address these global challenges, we must go on building bridges among allies around the globe in order to bring the rice to where it is needed to feed the people, to make investments to create jobs, and to keep the peace and maintain stability in the world.


It is therefore timely that the Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, has organized this years agenda around the impact of the global economy on the poor. He deserves our highest praise for his quick and decisive action on the global food crisis. His Comprehensive Framework for Action, involving the United Nations, donor countries, civil society and the private sector, seeks to achieve food security through the right combination of policies, technologies and investments. This is a model of the United Nations in action.


Since the volatile global economic situation became apparent many months ago, in the Philippines we have increased and stabilized the supply of rice and delivered targeted subsidies to the poor. We have reached out to neighbours such as Viet Nam and others in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and elsewhere to ensure a stable supply and affordable prices. We have clamped down on price gouging and invested additional billions in planting and agricultural modernization.


We have increased our energy independence by 17 per cent through greater use of geothermal energy, biofuels and other renewable sources, and we expect to attain 60 per cent energy independence in two years. Biofuels have been cited as being a positive factor for clean energy. At the same time, they have also been cited as a negative factor that contributes to high food prices. We are pursuing a policy of using non-food biofuel sources planted on land unusable for food production purposes. We see this approach as a way for countries to seek a sustainable balance between food and energy needs.


For food self-sufficiency, our food baskets are North Luzon in our largest island and the southern island of Mindanao. Mindanao has fields of the highest productivity, yet also the majority of our poorest provinces. It is a sad irony that our food basket has some of the highest incidences of hunger in our nation.


The prime reason is the endless Mindanao conflict. Our archipelago of 7,000 islands has had its share of religious strife, ethnic tension and violence. For years, we have worked to achieve peace in Mindanao. Much progress was made until violent elements within the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) decided to take the law into their own hands. We will restart the dialogue when the area is secure, when our people are safe and when responsible elements in the MILF regain control.


There is no alternative to peace. I stand before the Assembly today to declare loud and clear that we are committed to the process of peace in Mindanao. We gratefully acknowledge here today the central role of so many friends and allies, including the United Nations; Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Libya, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and others in the Organization of the Islamic Conference; Australia, New Zealand, the United States and other bilateral partners supplying official development assistance; and the European Union and Sweden. All have played a big role in advancing peace and development in Mindanao. We will refocus the peace talks from an approach that is centred on dialogue with rebels to one of authentic dialogue with the communities. The context of our engagement with all armed groups will subscribe to the United Nations-recognized principle of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration. We maintain high hopes in interfaith dialogue as a means of building bridges rather than barriers between communities of different cultures and ethnicity. In furtherance of this effort, the Philippines will host the first-ever Special Ministerial Meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement on Interfaith Dialogue and Cooperation for Peace and Development in May next year. We will also cooperate with the Alliance of Civilizations.


We are also pleased that the Secretary-General will join us in Manila during the second Global Forum on Migration and Development. Our overseas Filipino workers are true global pioneers. There is no ship abroad that does not have a Filipino crew or a nation that does not have highly skilled Filipino workers. The movement of people from one country to another will surely increase as globalization continues to erase borders. This fact should be recognized as having implications for the growth and development of both sending and receiving countries.


In many troubled places of our world, the United Nations is the last great hope for peace and security. For this reason, the Philippines contributes one of the largest police contingents to United Nations peacekeeping operations.


Mr. President, your leadership is more vital than ever. The Philippines will fully support you as you lead our General Assembly for the coming year. In conclusion, there are hundreds of millions of good people across this globe who are struggling as never before. We must hear their cry for help. It is within the collective power of the leaders at this United Nations General Assembly to fulfil the universal dream of better education, better health, food on the table and a dignified life."	2008-09-23
Alberto G. Romulo	UNGA 64	"Allow me to warmly congratulate you on your well-deserved election as the head of this 64th session of the UN General Assembly. Please count on the full cooperation of the Philippines as you discharge the duties of your high office.


We are gathered here today, in this parliament of the nations, to find meaningful solutions to conflict and crisis confronting our world today. Though there are signs of global recovery, now is neither the time for complacency nor for a return to business as usual. Our drive for enhancing global development has clearly slowed, while the challenges to peace remain starkly before us.


Through globalization, we have witnessed unprecedented material progress and record poverty alleviation. Yet the poorest 40 percent of the world population still live on less than $2 a day. Nor have we resolved the climate change and food crises that oppress hundreds of millions of human beings. Much of global development has been the fruits of labor, including the labor of migrant workers. Yet despite their contributions to the global economy, too many migrants remain exposed to exploitation and abused.


Moreover, the peace dividend from the end of the Cold War never materialized, even as we continue to confront nuclear proliferation and violent conflict. The shortage of aid resources, and faltering trade and investment, are generating a global development emergency. Many nations will not attain the MDGs on target. Development gains are being tragically lost.


Our march of progress must not stall. Not on our watch. Not while we have the will, the vision and the means to build a better world, inspired by a shared commitment to justice, equity, non-discrimination, progress and peace. And we should do so by focusing on five great challenges of our time: First: Promoting nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation;


Second: Managing the global crisis to encourage equitable recovery, fairer globalization and faster poverty alleviation;


Third: Protecting and promoting the rights of migrants who continue to contribute to global development and the well-being of our societies; Fourth: Taking urgent measures to effectively address the adverse effects of climate change without further delay; and Fifth: Reducing conflict and deepening mutual understanding and respect through greater interfaith and inter-civilizational dialogue.


DISARMAMENT AND NON-PROLIFERATION


Mr. President,


Nuclear weapons and their technology are a threat to international peace and security, and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is our central mechanism to contain and eventually eliminate this threat. The May 2010 NPT Review Conference, over which the Philippines will preside, provides the next opportunity for all of us to act on this in a concerted manner. We can be encouraged by certain recent development on this front. We have had the constructive atmosphere of the preparatory committee meetings to the Review Conference.


President Obama has announced that he will lead the US to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), another key pillar of the global disarmament and NPT system.


In addition, the United States and Russia are making headway under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) to reduce their deployed nuclear warheads and delivery systems beyond its pending expiry this December. The South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone (SEANWFZ) other regional nuclear free zones continue to reinforce the NPT system as well. These positive developments inspire the Philippines, in steering the review conference, to conduct negotiations and consultations in an open and transparent manner.


In this spirit, we reiterate our call for the few remaining countries that have not yet done so to accede to both the CTBT and the NPT in order to give greater hope for lasting peace and security for our world.


GLOBAL CRISIS, RECOVERY AND A NEW GLOBALIZATION


Mr. President,


The global financial and economic crisis is placing intolerable strain on the poorest of the poor undermining years of effort to attain internationally agreed development goals, including the MDGs, and to combat ill-heath and hunger.


The crisis has been accompanied by increases in unemployment, with concomitant declining incomes and demand. The ILO estimates that unemployment could rise by 50 million during 2009, taking the global unemployment rate to above 7 per cent.


The Philippines and many other nations are implementing stimulus packages, accelerated employment generation programs and enhanced social safety nets. In the Philippines we strengthened our banking sector and fiscal position through tough reforms, which blunted the full force of the global crisis. The Philippines is one of the few economies that continue to have positive GDP growth.


However, we cannot ignore the impact of the global crisis elsewhere in our interdependent world. The Philippines thus joins other nations in this General Assembly in calling for a united effort in the United Nations to act for the common good of all our peoples.


The UN Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development, held in this very hall last June, presented UN Member States with lines of action that we must take now to stimulate the global economy, improve regulation and monitoring, and reform processes and institutions to prevent any recurrence of this crisis.


We see the Global Jobs Pact that the International Labor Organization (ILO) put forward, and which was endorsed by the ECOSOC last July, as another important step to recover from this crisis.


We reiterate our call on all countries to resist protectionism, in order to expand trade and investment flows, and on developed nations to maintain their ODA commitments.


Furthermore, the voice of the developing world must now be fully heard in reforming international financial and development institutions so that we can forge a more equitable and stable global economic system to avoid future crises.


MIGRANT WORKERS AND GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT AND WELL-BEING


Mr. President,


Global migrants are among the groups most adversely affected by the crisis. The international community, therefore, has a shared responsibility, to ensure their protection, taking into full account the special vulnerabilities of the gender and family dimensions of the issue. The Second Global Forum on Migration and Development (GFMD), which the Philippines was privileged to chair, reinforced this important message by focusing on the human face of migration, and on the human rights and empowerment of migrants.


In this regard, we also urge all nations to accede to the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, and to avoid unfair restrictions and treatment of migrants. [Only in this manner can we protect them from the crisis and ensure that they can continue their positive contributions to the global economy.]


MITIGATING AND ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE


Mr. President,


We must carry the momentum of the Summit on Climate Change here in New York forward into the negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on the road to Copenhagen this December. The world expects nothing less from us.


The Philippines, therefore, calls on the concerned developed countries to present their firm post-Kyoto greenhouse gas emission targets, taking into account the ideal levels suggested by the scientific community. They must also assist developing countries mitigate and adapt to worsening climate change by fulfilling their UNFCCC obligations to provide technological and financial support. As a coordinator of the G-77 in the talks, the Philippines will continue to work with all parties to help ensure a positive outcome in Copenhagen.


The Philippines is doing its part to advance this vital global agenda. We have recently enacted a landmark law promoting the development and use of renewable energy resources, especially biofuels.


Earlier this month, the Philippines also hosted the International Conference on Green Industry in Asia. The Manila Declaration on Green Industry in Asia and Framework of Action adopted by that Conference promoted the integration of sustainable development into industrial development processes for the transition to resource-efficient and low-carbon industries. We hope that elements of the Manila Declaration will provide inputs for Copenhagen as well.


GREATER INTERFAITH AND INTERCIVILIZATIONAL DIALOGUE


Mr. President,


The international community must also focus on the urgent need to reduce tension and conflict fueled by perceived differences in religion, faith and civilization. If left unattended, such conflict can fester, causing greater tension and untold human suffering and violence, which extremists can exploit. The urgency of this matter has prompted the Philippines and many partner nations and organizations to promote greater interfaith dialogue, within the United Nations system as well as on regional and national levels. By building bridges of understanding, this global advocacy enhances peace and development.


The Philippines has tabled annually a UN resolution calling for interreligious and intercultural dialogue, understanding and cooperation for peace, which the UN General Assembly has always adopted unanimously. We initiated in the UN the Ministerial Meeting on Interfaith Dialogue and Cooperation for Peace, composed of countries from all regions of the world. In 2006, we also launched a global Tripartite Forum on Interfaith Cooperation for Peace, headquartered in New York, made up of 54 governments, 15 UN agencies and 110 religious NGOs at the UN. To reinforce this effort, the Philippines will host the first Special Non- Aligned Movement (NAM) Ministerial Meeting on Interfaith Dialogue and Cooperation for Peace and Development in Manila this December. We are pleased to invite all UN and NAM members and other interested nations as observer to this important and seminal meeting.


UN PEACEKEEPING


The spirit of multilateralism and prudent realism demands that we support UN peacekeeping efforts. In crises and emergencies around the world, we must collectively do more to alleviate suffering and to help nations and communities secure self-sustaining peace.


The Philippines will continue to be active in UN peacekeeping. Indeed, the Philippines has become one of the largest contributors of individual police officers to UN peacekeeping operations. We have more than 600 peacekeepers serving with distinction around the world. Next month, we will send a battalion in support of the UN Disengagement Observer Force in the Golan Heights.


CONCLUSION


Mr. President,


We stand on the cusp of history. It is in our hands, here in the United Nations, to shape these changes and trends so that we will leave to succeeding generations a lasting legacy of a world of greater justice, compassion, and wellbeing. The Philippines is deeply honored to assist and cooperate with all nations in the task of building a future where peace and prosperity reign unceasingly for the benefit of all mankind.


Thank you."	2009-09-25
Benigno S. Aquino III	UNGA 65	"Mr. President:


Allow me to convey the greetings of the Filipino people to you and the delegates gathered for the 65th session of the UN General Assembly. The United Nations was founded on the belief that in collective action lies collective security. It is when nations reach across their borders that the immense problems of our age begin to be manageable.


In a world that has become increasingly globalized, the challenges that we face have become globalized as well. Climate change; pandemics; terrorism and weapons of mass destruction; transnational organized crime such as human trafficking and the illicit drug trade; the continuing vulnerability of migrants, women, persons with disabilities, and the poor; and the challenges posed by increasingly interconnected economies all call for a further strengthening of international cooperation.


All of us here, representing our respective nations, are stewards entrusted with the well-being of our respective peoples. We are also called to be responsible and responsive members of the community of nations. Clearly, we are already aware that the problem of one poses a problem for all. Any solution, then, depends on us recognizing that each of our nations does not exist in a vacuum, but rather, in an increasingly interdependent global milieu.


The central revelation here is that for humanity to progress, all nations must progress as one. The quest for universal human dignity should not be defined by geographical, racial, or cultural boundaries, nor should it be set back by our desires to move our own nations forward. Global progress means equitable progress.


The industrialized nations of the world can look with pride on the living standards their peoples enjoy. But, as one of my distinguished predecessors once said, Those who have less in life should have more in law. This basic principle of social justice is also the most basic humanitarian challenge of our times. The wealth of nations must become an instrument to move the world further along the straight and righteous path of compassion and communal responsibility. The message is clear: there are those who need help, and acting with compassion toward those who need help is a response that is both humane and necessary.


This idea has been trumpeted for decades, and yet, combating inequality remains one of the greatest challenges of our times. The chasm between the powerful and powerless, the haves and the have-nots, remains to be bridged. The past century has demonstrated, in terms so stark that it inspired the creation of this organization, that when the mighty clash, those who have less end up trampled. This is true where conflict exists, and true where markets exist; true in our nation, and true in an international context.


The concept of vulnerability and inequality is all too clear in the global effort to address climate change. Those who stand to lose much, if not everything, from the effects of man-induced climatic conditions are those who did little to cause it. There is an enormous need to ensure, as a matter of justice, that countries, particularly the vulnerable, are assisted in their adaptation and disaster risk-reduction efforts and are provided the necessary resources to build climate-resilient communities. This should go hand-in-hand with ambitious commitments by major economies to significantly reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. Many of you may say you have already given mightily of your resources. But surely we do not need flood and famine to remind ourselves that there is so much more that must be given, because there are so many more who deserve the hope of a better life.


The most immediate focus of cooperation demanded of us today is to collectively ensure that the eight Millennium Development Goals will be achieved by all in the remaining five years. This is a daunting task; and we are all aware that national resolve has to be complemented by bilateral, regional and multilateral cooperation.


Rising to the challenges of our era requires, within each of our countries, a strengthened regulatory system. This does not mean a cumbersome, intrusive government, but rather a government that allows private enterprise to thrive, while ensuring that they remain cognizant of their social responsibilities, and empowers them, in turn, toward fulfilling these responsibilities. Many governments are tackling this challenge, including the government of the Philippines. Our administrations pledge: To channel the gains we might reap from Public Private Partnerships into social services, like those in health, education, and poverty alleviation.


Across boundaries, the battle against inequality requires a balanced approach from those in authority: to be conscious of our responsibilities to our own people, and of our duties to regions and the globe. Already we are witnessing a rethinking of traditional paradigms, a shifting of our focus towards ensuring that the global system does not leave anyone behind.


And while my nation continues to benefit from the compassion of those who are more able to help, this does not mean that we, or our friends in the developing world, will be entirely dependent on the largesse of the developed world. We will not be passive players in our quest for development. My nation remains active in the G77 and other efforts toward enhancing South-South cooperation, and articulating and promoting our collective economic interests. This is what our people put us in power for. This is what the world expects of us as leadersto be exemplars of what it is to be compassionate human beings, and vanguards of hope for our common humanity.


For is not this hope also the hope that unites us as human beings? It is the same hope that allows us to break down walls of mistrust, which may take the form of intolerance, fear, or violence. It is the same hope that leads us to gather in this hall as our predecessors did. It is the same hope that will give our generation of leaders the strength to elevate this global assembly to a place where, collectively, the nations of the world could find ways to make a better life possible for all.


For so many times in our history, my people have shown that, united, nothing is impossible. We called it People Power. It is my earnest hopeand in the greatest interest of humanitythat we harness the energies of dialogue, solidarity, and communal responsibility, so that a global People Power toward equitable progress may be achieved.


Thank you."	2010-09-24
Libran N. Cabactulan	UNGA 66	"Mr. President:


Allow me at the outset to congratulate you on your election and to offer the Philippines' full support for your leadership in this 66th Session of the United Nations General Assembly.


Our collective experience as one United Nations has brought to bear the reality that it is only when nations work together - in firm and determined resolve - can we begin to address the many difficulties that confront us.


A Framework for our Work


Mr. President:


Two global wars exposed our vulnerability to leaders and nations that do not hesitate to use violence to resolve disputes, and underscored the need for an international system to govern the behavior of states.


This is the rules-based framework that underpins everything we want to build, raise and do as one United Nations. This framework - built by our shared values and common aspirations - provides the way by which we can effectively move together as one global community towards our common objectives.


For the Philippines, therefore, this session's theme, ""The Role of Mediation in the Settlement of Disputes by Peaceful Means,"" is most relevant and opportune. Peace through an International Rules-based System


Mr. President:


A rules-based system will only work in a sustained manner if the rules themselves are created based on principles of justice and equity. Recent events across the globe, particularly in the Middle East, have shown us that individuals rise together for what they believe is just and equitable. Individuals clamor for the rule of law based on equity and fairness. When they realize the injustice of repressive and iniquitous rule, they will not hesitate to bring effective and positive change.


Building Peace and Strengthening International Security through Disarmament


Mr. President:


We must continue our work in eliminating nuclear weapons and curtailing the illicit trade in conventional weapons and small and light arms, to preserve peace and our very existence.


The Philippines believes in the importance of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty for the success of our work, as the only legally binding instrument that calls for the elimination of nuclear weapons.


The successful 2010 NPT Review Conference showed the collective resolve of States Parties to move further forward in ridding the world of these weapons. We have already agreed to convene a conference by 2012 on the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. The holding of this conference will take us closer to our goal.


Building Peace through Equitable and Sustained Development


Mr. President:


To build peace, we need to provide and strengthen conditions that encourage the full progress and prosperity of all nations and peoples. We must ensure that international trade and development support this end. The Philippines therefore calls for a fair, open and rules-based multilateral trading system and the conclusion of the Doha round.


We must likewise redouble our efforts in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. The target date of 2015 is upon us and much work remains to be done. The Philippines is one of 17 mega-diverse countries and has a great stake in ensuring that global biodiversity is protected and maintained. We have been described as the ""epicenter of global marine biodiversity"" and hosts the ASEAN Center for Biodiversity.


As we look forward to the Rio+20 Conference next year, we join the call for a more powerful expression of the entire world's political commitment for sustainable development


Protecting our Human Resources and Upholding Human Dignity


Mr. President:


With the human person at the core of all our efforts, we must always strive to uphold human dignity and human rights.


This holds true for migrant workers. The Philippines has close to 10 million Filipinos overseas contributing to global socio-economic development.


In line with the rules-based approach, the Philippines supports the establishment of guidelines that would ensure the welfare of all migrant workers. Additionally, we must renew our resolve to address the evils of human trafficking. In the Philippines, we have embarked on an intensive ""all-of-government"" effort to combat trafficking in persons in the areas of protection, prevention and prosecution.


The Philippines is also a founding member of the Group of Friends United against Human Trafficking, an informal association of UN Member States that seeks to help reinvigorate and consolidate the global fight against trafficking in persons. At the core of this initiative is the implementation of the Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons.


Aside from establishing rules to protect migrant workers and to prevent human trafficking, the global community needs to explore measures to more effectively assist developing countries in evacuating their nationals in instances of disaster or internal conflict. The Philippines also supports efforts at the United Nations to enhance partnerships, including with private sector actors, in strengthening the international humanitarian and emergency response system.


Peace and Human Rights


Mr. President:


The Philippines recognizes that the promotion and protection of human rights is of vital importance to secure peace and socio-economic development, promote the rule of law, and strengthen democracies.


The Philippine government likewise recognizes women as agents of socioeconomic growth and change and thus strongly advocates their full participation in nation building.


Mr. President:


The Philippines is pleased to announce that last August 30, we deposited our instrument of ratification for the Statute of the International Criminal Court. This is an historic moment for my country and my people. We have stood up against the impunity of colonial rule and of a dictatorship. This time, we stand together with the rest of the world in saying ""never again,"" to impunity, in any corner of our world.


Firm in the desire to contribute to global efforts to safeguard the world against impunity, the Philippines has fielded a candidate for election to the Court: Professor Dr. Miriam Defensor Santiago, an experienced trial judge and international legal scholar, with a distinguished and long career in public service. We ask all our partners and friends to kindly support her candidature.


Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding


As we look to strengthen the ramparts of peace, we recognize the important role and contributions of peacekeeping and peacebuilding at the United Nations. With around 800 men and women serving in peacekeeping missions around the world, the Philippines stands ready to do its part to ensure that the lines of peace are fortified and continuously expanded.


The Philippines lauds the heightened interaction and dialogue among the Secretariat, the General Assembly, the Security Council, troop and police contributing countries, and other key stakeholders in the global peacekeeping agenda.


Maritime Piracy


As we strive to reinforce peacekeeping operations on land, so too should we continue to exert efforts in maintaining stability and security at sea. Maritime piracy, after all, imperils lives of seafarers and disrupts global trade.


Today, around 70 Filipino seafarers are still held hostage by pirates operating in the Gulf of Aden and the wider Indian Ocean. We must continue to work strongly against these sea pirates who should have no place in our modern civilized world.


Reforms at the Security Council


Mr. President:


To strengthen an international rules-based regime, the Philippines advocates UN reforms aimed at making our Organization more resilient, relevant and responsive, particularly in the Security Council. On.record, it is only the Philippines that presented specific drafts of resolutions concretely stating the proposals on the five key issues - categories of membership, question of the veto, size of the enlarged Security Council and working methods, relationship between the General Assembly and the Security Council and question of regional representation.


Counter Terrorism


Terrorism continues to cast its dark shadow on us all. The decapitation of terrorist organizations has not put an end to terrorism. We need to address the root causes and conditions that transform individuals with so much passion into beasts that know nothing else but violence to achieve their ends. Among many things, we need to further examine how economic disenfranchisement, intolerance and radicalization contribute to the growth of terrorist groups.


Peace and the Rule of Law


Mr. President:


The rule of law, including the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, is key to finding solutions to disputes on conflicting claims in the West Philippine Sea. As we prepare to commemorate the 30th anniversary of UNCLOS next year, let all States Parties remember not just our rights but also our obligations.


For the rule of law is the bedrock on which the growth and development of our community of nations is built. Adherence to the rule of law provides stability and certainty in the conduct of relations between states. In a world defined by inequality in economic, military and political resources and might, the rule of law is the great equalizer, ensuring that rights are protected and responsibilities are complied with. Adherence to the rule of law prevents conflicts. And in instances of disputes - particularly of a territorial nature - the rule of law ensures peaceful settlement and resolution.


The rule of law has guided the Philippines in all its actions as a responsible member of the international community. The Philippines realizes that only when the rule of law prevails can all stakeholders and the world benefit from a region of such strategic and resource importance.


In the meantime, we will adhere to ASEAN's 1992 Manila Declaration on the West Philippine Sea and the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the West Philippine Sea and call on other parties to do so. We also welcome the efforts and support of other stakeholders in working towards a lasting, just and peaceful solution to the conflicting claims in our region.


Mr. President:


Let me conclude by saying that underpinning the success of all our efforts in the United Nations is adherence to the rule of law and rules-based international system. Out of the horrors of wars, we have resolved as one global community to build and strengthen the ramparts of peace and development. Those ramparts, strong as they may be, can easily disintegrate when even just one nation behaves contrary to the rules and norms we have elected to abide by, It is our obligation as individual nations and as a collective global community that all nations - big or small - behave responsibly through adherence to the rule of law and a rules-based regime. Only then can we hope to enjoy the benefits of our world and live together in greater peace, progress and prosperity. 


Thank you."	2011-09-27
Albert F. del Rosario	UNGA 67	"Adherence to the Rule of Law: Right is Might


Mr. President,


Allow me to congratulate you on your election and to offer the steadfast support of my country for your presidency.


Each year we renew our commitment to our United Nations and the Charter that enshrines, in the plainest of language, our hopes and aspirations for a progressive, peaceful and secure world.


Our Organization and our Charter have survived and thrived through dark times and great adversity. The letter and spirit of our Charter remain alive and vibrant in a constantly changing world. Our work continues to be important, even in the face of doubts about the relevance of multilateral institutions.


All these were possible because at the heart of our determination to build peace has been our commitment to the rule of law.


Keeping faith in the law allows us to treat each other fairly and in the spirit of sovereign equality. It provides the rules with which nations can relate and work together. It reduces arbitrariness and unilateralism. Fidelity to the rule of law allows us not only the means to resolve differences, but also the substance on which to build better understanding.


ADVOCACY FROM NATIONAL EXPERIENCE


Our advocacy on the Rule of Law is borne not only out of our experience and insights as a founding member of the United Nations and an active participant in international affairs.


Our advocacy is deeply rooted in our experience as a nation. Our freedom was hard won. Our democracy realized only after decades of dictatorship. Our governance sullied by corruption and patronage in previous years.


Our President, Benigno S. Aquino III, has placed the rule of law at the center of his governance. As a result, the culture of impunity has been neutralized, our economy is on the upswing and our people's rights and freedoms assured.


DISARMAMENT AND THE RULE OF LAW


Among the gravest threats that continue to face us today is the deadly testament of man's ability to destroy his fellow man.


The full force of the rule of law must be brought to bear to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, to promote nuclear disarmament and to end the flow of illicit weapons. The Philippines is proud to have presided over the 2010 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The historic adoption of the 64 Action Points strengthened the legal regime of the Treaty.


We also support Nuclear Weapons Free Zones, including the Southeast Asian Nuclear Weapons Free Zone (SEANWFZ) that ASEAN created. It is essential that such a zone be created for the volatile Middle East, as envisaged by the 2010 NPT RevCon. The Philippines commends the States from the region, the depository States of the 1995 Resolution, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the Government of Finland for setting the stage for the 2012 Conference that will seek this most urgent objective.


The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) is another critical pillar of global disarmament and non-proliferation. The Philippines commends Indonesia for being the latest Annex 2 State to ratify and reiterates its call on the remaining eight Annex 2 States to accede at the soonest possible time. Other States not included in Annex 2, but are not party to the CTBT, must do the same to ensure the universality of this treaty.


PEACEKEEPING: ENFORCING RULES AND LAWS


We must also actively pursue respect for the law of peace and humanitarian law in the numerous regional conflicts that affect the lives, safety and wellbeing of millions of people around the world. Towards this end, Peacekeeping is the crucial tool by which the Charter's mandate are carried out.


Despite its limited resources, the Philippines is doing its part in this important task. We are currently a major contributor to UN peacekeeping missions. We call on others to also do all that they can. And we support innovative efforts to help embattled communities, including proposals on possible unarmed peacekeeping that would expand the civilian component of our endeavors.


The Philippines also recognizes the important role played by women in the promotion of peace and continues to deploy more female peacekeepers to peacekeeping missions. We aim to attain and surpass the 10% deployment target of women in country troop contingents and 20% for police deployments.


RULES-BASED PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS


With a tenth of the population of our country in foreign lands, there is a very real and human dimension for our quest to strengthen the rule of law.


To further galvanize international dialogue and cooperation, the Philippines has been among the principal advocates of developing norms of international law that will protect not only our overseas Filipinos but all migrants.


Human trafficking is a crime of such magnitude that it cannot be dealt with by a single nation or even a group of nations. The international community as a whole must stand together against this scourge. For this reason, the Philippines became a founding member of the Group of Friends United Against Human Trafficking and we are the main sponsor of the biennial General Assembly resolution on Trafficking in Women and Girls.


In pursuit of this objective, we call on all Member States to implement the Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons and to ratify and enforce human rights instruments, such as the Palermo Protocol and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of Migrant Persons and Members of their Families.


Many of my countrys overseas Filipinos are found on merchants ships. Filipinos form the bulk of seafarers. Many have fallen victim to pirates.


Maritime piracy continues to be a menace for the entire world. 80% of world trade travels by sea - almost six billion tons of cargo, moved by some 93,000 merchant vessels, manned by 1.25 million seafarers. The business and human costs of piracy cannot be overstated. We encourage bilateral, multilateral, regional and inter-regional efforts to address the impact of piracy, including measures to improve the welfare of affected seafarers.


THE HUMANITARIAN AND HUMAN RIGHTS IMPERATIVE


Mr. President,


The Philippine Constitution values the dignity of every human person and guarantees full respect for all human rights. Our National Human Rights Action Plan 2009-2014 aims to mainstream human rights standards into all parts of the national government and of national life. The Plan fully respects our obligations under the eight major international human rights treaties.


As a founding and current member of the Human Rights Council, the Philippines works with other members of the Council to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable groups such as migrants, women and children, the youth and the elderly, indigenous peoples, and persons with disabilities. The Philippines has actively contributed to initiatives on human rights and extreme poverty, on human rights education, on combating trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and on climate change.


The Philippines was one of the first nations to submit itself to the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process of the Human Rights Council. Last month, the Council adopted by consensus our second UPR report.


The noble vision of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and of many other profound declarations, is far from being realized for the poor, the deprived, the oppressed and the marginalized. The recent global financial and economic crises have left these vulnerable segments of our peoples even more in danger.


The Philippine government, therefore, strongly supports measures for empowerment of these disadvantaged and endangered groups, and strongly advocates policies that aim to raise their participation and integration in society.


Hence the importance of attaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and planning for the post-MDG period after 2015. Thus, the Philippines, together with Tanzania, initiated the resolution, entitled High Level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Realization of the Millennium Development Goals and Other Internationally Agreed Development Goals for Persons with Disabilities. The 2013 high level meeting aims at inclusiveness of the disabled, a cause to which all should rally.


We are also instituting measures to enhance the role and status of women, and in strengthening their protection, through the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), whose foundation predates the Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), through the key legislation of the Magna Carta of Women and through the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (PPGRD) 1995-2015.


MIGRATION AND DEVELOPMENT


Mr. President,


Migration remains an unheralded and underappreciated dimension of globalization today. Yet the reality is that hundreds of millions live and work outside their native lands, providing benefits to both their host nations and their countries of origin.


The Global Forum on Migration and Development (GFMD), which the Philippines chaired in 2008, allows us to share practical experiences in migration management and in protecting the rights and welfare of all migrants. We look forward to a successful GFMD summit outcome in Port Louis, Mauritius, this coming November.


Earlier this year, the Philippines had the honor of ratifying two key international instruments affecting migrants everywhere: the Maritime Labor Convention (MLC) and the Convention concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers. Philippine ratification brings these two agreements into force next year.


As a further indication of our commitment to protect the rights of migrants, the Philippines will be co-hosting a GFMD regional meeting in Manila on International Migrant Domestic Care Workers at the Interface of Migration and Development later this month, with the support of UN Women, ILO and IOM.


THE SEARCH FOR DEVELOPMENTAL JUSTICE


The rule of law is an instrument of justice and development. Yet, continuing global economic challenges and financial instability make it ever more important that we focus on making sure that the rule of law gives everyone their due. Poverty, hunger, poor health and education and a deteriorating environment are threats to all and require nothing less than our concerted collective response.


In all development efforts, we must respect the principles and norms of sustainability that are crucial for continued health of the Earth and of our peoples. Consequently, the Philippines will further integrate key ideas from Rio+20 into its Medium-Term Development Plan review, even as we continue to pursue the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. For many developing countries like the Philippines, food security remains an essential issue. Recent events have shown that the capacity to source food in an affordable fashion can affect millions, sometimes even to the extent of their sheer survival. We express our appreciation to the General Assembly for the adoption at its last session of the resolution declaring 2014 as the International Year of Family Farming.


As a country particularly prone to natural disasters, including those wrought by climate change, we value the work being done in advancing natural disaster risk reduction management. Global and regional cooperation through partnerships is the best means for strengthening the international humanitarian and emergency response system.


THE RULE OF LAW AND THE PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES


Natural disasters plague mankind. The forces of nature are difficult to contain. This should not be the case in mans quest for peace. While natural disasters are impossible to prevent, the same is not true for war and conflict.


The United Nations was created to protect the weak from the strong, to provide for the equality of all sovereign states, and to enshrine the rule of law as the governing principle in regulating international disputes.


As such, the Philippines is steadfast in promoting the peaceful settlement of disputes using a rules-based approach. We stand firmly behind efforts in the United Nations to promote the rule of law and mediation.


In 1982, we adopted the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Manila Declaration. The principles and processes enunciated in the Manila Declaration remain applicable to this day and is a stark reminder that we have yet to overcome the barriers that divide countries and peoples all over the planet. It is for this reason, Mr. President, that we all share your view that bringing about adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means is essential for the future peace, progress and prosperity of all nations.


Furthermore, from the perspective of the rule of law, and given the maritime disputes that have intensified in the Asian region, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea has never been more relevant than it is today. All States must respect their obligations to settle their maritime disputes by peaceful means, without threats or use of force, under UNCLOS. A rules-based approach under UNCLOS can peacefully resolve these Asian maritime disputes. Today, my country faces its most serious challenge to the security of its maritime domain and integrity of its national territory, as well as its effective protection of its marine environment. To address this challenge and to arrive at a durable resolution, we must rely on the rule of law and not the force of arms. We must rely on the body of rules that state that disputes must be resolved peacefully. We must rely on the norms and rules enshrined in the UNCLOS.


We therefore rely on our friends and allies and all those who believe in the peaceful and fair management of the seas and oceans to uphold the rule of law and UNCLOS. We will endeavor to elicit a more proactive action from the General Assembly.


CONCLUSION


Mr. President, we often hear the quote that we are a country of laws and not of men. I shall modify it to say that we are a community of nations and not of hegemons.


Let us make this a reality. Let us all, without exception, respect the international legal framework to utilize institutions and adhere to commitments in treaties and conventions. For in so doing, we create global norms that will serve our nations in good stead today and in the future, and we will preserve the one great institution that we have charged with promoting peace and prosperity in our world, our United Nations.


Excellencies,


Ladies and gentlemen,


If we achieve this, rather than being forced to accept that might is right, we will instead demonstrate that right is might.


Thank you."	2012-10-01
Albert F. del Rosario	UNGA 68	"Contributing to the Post-2015 Development Agenda: The Philippine Experience


Mr. President,


On behalf of the Philippine government, I proffer my warmest congratulations on your election. I wish you success in your work, and assure you of my country's steadfast support for your presidency.


Mr. President,


The theme that has been selected for your Presidency is indeed timely and relevant. We must start setting the stage for the new development agenda which will succeed the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) framework. Barely two years before its deadline, we still have considerable work ahead of us. For instance, the global economic and financial crisis has underscored the need for reform towards greater systemic coherence; the multilateral trading system remains frozen in the past; and the persistence of an outdated development paradigm results in policy prescriptions and conditionalities inimical to the interests of many developing countries.


Mr. President,


As we set the stage for the Post-2015 framework, let us reaffirm the very raison d'etre of the United Nations: which is to accord every person the opportunity at a life that is secure, progressive and dignified.


That purpose is enshrined in the Philippine Constitution, and is central to President Benigno S. Aquino Ill's ""Social Contract with the Filipino People."" Under President Aquino's leadership, my country has embarked on a journey along a straight path - or, as we say in Filipino, ""Daang Matuwid"" - resolving to work towards inclusive growth, combating corruption, promoting transparency and accountability, improving global competitiveness, making better use of resources, achieving just and lasting peace, and upholding the rule of law.


The Aquino Administration firmly maintains that ""Good governance is good economics."" As a result, the Philippines is reaping the first fruits of its hard work. In the last four quarters, the Philippine economy experienced unprecedented growth of over 7 percent. As a result, the Philippines won three (3) investment-grade ratings, and is now considered a ""growth engine"" in the region.


These glowing reports are, of course, well received by my government. We are under no illusion, however, that these indicators alone constitute success. For the past 13 years, the MDGs have been integrated in the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) for 2011 to 2016. Yet, our work continues, and the challenge we now face is clear:


It is how to ensure that growth is inclusive, resilient and sustainable.


THE PHILIPPINE EXPERIENCE: LESSONS LEARNED IN WORKING TOWARDS THE MDGs


As we pursue the path towards this very type of growth, my government is guided by the following important lessons learned from our experience in working towards the Millennium Development Goals:


First, strong institutional arrangements are necessary. For the Philippines, this means that the highest political support is given to the attainment of the MDGs, involving all branches of government and other key stakeholders.


Second, specific policies, programs and projects must be aligned with national development goals. In our MDGs experience, innovative social protection programs include Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT), Universal Health Care (UHC), Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of Social Services (ClOSS), K-12 Basic Education Program and Community Mortgage Program (CMP).


Third, the active participation of various stakeholders, namely, the private sector, civil society and non-government organizations, the constituents and international development partners, must be strongly promoted and supported. This ensures that the policies and programs are responsive and inclusive.


Fourth, local government units should be empowered. Beyond the delivery of basic social services, the capacities of local government units in formulating and implementing policies and programs must be strengthened, guided by the principles of transparency and accountability.


Fifth, the capability to generate accurate, timely and relevant data at the national and local levels must be enhanced.


Sixth, disaster risk reduction must be mainstreamed to enable communities to better cushion the impact of man-made and natural disasters. Building the capacities of national and local stakeholders to help reduce the vulnerability and increase physical and economic resilience of communities must be a key development goal.


These important elements will further enrich the UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) 2012-2018 for the Philippines. With the overall theme, ""Supporting inclusive, sustainable and resilient development,"" the UNDAF aims to fully align the UN work with the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) for 2011 to 2016.


My government is actively participating in the international discourse on sustainable development and in crafting the post-2015 development agenda. The Philippines was one of 66 countries chosen by the UN to conduct open, inclusive and transparent consultations with a broad range of stakeholders aimed at generating perspectives on how the post-2015 development agenda framework should look. We took to this task earnestly by undertaking consultations with over 500 stakeholders representing government, civil society, the business community and the acaderne.


THE PHILIPPINES' PROPOSED 'BUILDING BLOCKS' FOR THE POST-2015 DEVELOPMENT AGENDA


Mr. President,


Our national consultations on the post-2015 development agenda have identified the building blocks of the new framework as well as the development themes deemed most relevant to the Philippines. These building blocks are composed of four principles, five themes and various development enablers and were offered to the UN system as the Philippine contribution to the ongoing discourse.


We need look no further than the United Nations Charter to identify the building blocks for the global post-2015 development agenda. For this agenda to be relevant and responsive, it must be anchored on four main principles, namely:


1. Human Rights; 

2. Equality, Equity, People Empowerment, Social Cohesion and Justice; 

3. Accountable Governance; and 

4. Inclusive Development


For my country, we have identified five pillars that we believe will address our own specific development challenges. These pillars represent the areas where progress is most needed to build a rights-based, equitable and sustainable society. These pillars are:


First, poverty reduction and social inclusion;


Second, environment sustainabi/ity, climate change and disaster risk management; Third, accountable, responsive and participatory governance;


Fourth, a fair and stable order based on the international rule of law; and


Fifth, peace and security.


My government will formulate and implement policies that will be defined by these pillars. These policies will duly be integrated into my country's national development agenda, and the progress will be monitored at regular intervals.


On the global front, the Philippines proposes that the post-2015 development agenda have a duration of 10 years, with a major review to be undertaken by 2020. Reforms should be frontloaded within the first half of the period, to pave the way for substantive accomplishments by 2020. Mr. President,


Allow me to further elaborate on aspects of the principles and themes the Philippines has put forward.


The Philippines continues to aspire for a global economic system that places development at the center, and one that promotes democracy in international economic decision-making. Ultimately, it behooves us to consider reform of the overall global economic system as we craft a sound sustainable development agenda.


To achieve meaningful reform, what we need now is a strong political impetus from all of us to make this happen. Governments must see beyond political differences, and agree to work together to ensure a global level playing field. It is for this reason that the Philippines staunchly supports the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development Goals.


ADDRESSING MIGRATION: THE PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS OF MIGRANTS


Mr. President,


The post-2015 development agenda should squarely address migration. It is a cross-cutting issue relevant to our efforts to promote human rights, reduce poverty and foster sustainable development. The Philippines, for its part, will continue to advocate the protection of the rights of migrants, regardless of migration status; the recognition of migrants' positive contribution to development in both the sending and receiving countries; and the creation of programs which support families, especially children who are left behind.


Our national experience in these issues will be my government's contribution to the discussion in the forthcoming High Level Dialogue on Migration and Development later this week. In addition, we hope to include in the discussion the plight of migrants who find themselves in conflict areas, a situation that my government has had to address in recent years.


In several instances, we repatriated Filipino workers to get them out of harm's way. Our experience has been instructive and enriching, as it opened for us new windows of cooperation with our bilateral partners as well as with the UN, International Organization for Migration and other international organizations. My government wants to focus international discussion to the plight of these migrants, with the view to forging creative platforms on which states - whether countries of origin, transit or destination - can cooperate to better address this complex issue.


The Philippines hopes that the High-Level Dialogue will reaffirm that migration is an indispensable element in the global sustainable development agenda. Migration influences each country's socio-economic growth, human capital, and involvement in global affairs. Managing migration, through policies that uphold the dignity of the individual, should therefore be a vital component in the development agenda of each nation and of the world.


UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW: ARBITRATION AS A PEACEFUL MEANS TO SETTLE DISPUTES


Mr. President,


Achieving sustainable development requires an enabling environment of peace, security and the rule of law.


It is to this end that my government's approach in managing conflicts within and outside our borders is anchored on international law. As such, we avail ourselves of the various means for the peaceful settlement of disputes, including mediation and arbitration, in accordance with Chapter 6 of the U.N. Charter. As declared by the General Assembly in its resolution 37/10 on the ""Peaceful settlement of disputes between States,"" otherwise known as the 1982 Manila Declaration, the ""recourse to judicial settlement of legal disputes should not be considered an unfriendly act between States."" On the contrary, it is a measure that would generate clarity, benefitting all stakeholders. In this spirit, my country reaffirms its unwavering support for the International Court of Justice, and the various specialized tribunals, such as the dispute settlement mechanisms of the World Trade Organization and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.


The Philippines has also relentlessly and tirelessly pursued the peace process in the Southern Philippines. The signing of Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro is a milestone in this regard. We remain steadfastly committed to achieving just and lasting peace that will be inclusive for all.


Furthermore, in accordance with the application of the rule of law and the peaceful settlement of disputes, the Philippines, as a State Party to the Chemical Weapons Convention and a staunch advocate of disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, also welcomes Syria's accession to the Treaty. The Philippines hopes that the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will effectively assist the Syrian Government in disposing of its chemical weapons stockpiles.


PROMOTING PEACE: THE PHILIPPINES' STEADFAST COMMITMENT TO PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS


The Philippine government's commitment to peace is resolute. This commitment is demonstrated in our continued participation in UN's peacekeeping missions, particularly in UN Disengagement Observer Force in the occupied Golan, where, despite the dangers, our peacekeepers stood their ground. Their courage to stay and hold the line at the most critical time led to the continued fulfillment of UNDOF's mandate as charged by the UN Security Council.


ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE AND NATURAL DISASTERS: THE PHILIPPINE MODEL


Mr. President,


The Post-2015 development agenda also demands that governments address the devastating effects of climate change and natural disasters. My country is among the highest at risk in terms of typhoons, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis. In terms of disaster management, my government has instituted the cluster model that mobilizes both government and non-government entities from the local to national levels, as well as international partners. The UN has recognized this model as a best practice that other countries can emulate. We will continue to share our knowledge and experience in disaster risk reduction, preparedness, response and recovery to help other states better manage similar occurrences.


In 2015, we will also actively participate in the World Humanitarian Summit and in the review of the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA), our blueprint for Disaster Risk Reduction cooperation.


CONCLUSION


Mr. President,


The year 2015 marks an important juncture in the history of nations. This will mark the beginning of a new era of sustainable development, hopefully, one that gives every individual on this planet a better chance at a better quality of life.


This may sound ambitious. This may sound even daunting. Yet, this is a historic time and historic times call for acts of great ambition.


Our national hero, Dr. Jose Rizal, also recognized the importance of ambition and ideals. He wrote that, ""It is a useless life that is not consecrated to a great ideal. It is like a stone washed in the field without becoming part of an edifice.""


Mr. President,


Let the Post-2015 Development Agenda be the edifice upon which we will manifest the collective dreams and ideals of humanity."	2013-09-30
Albert F. del Rosario	UNGA 69	"The Challenges to Peace and Development


Mr. President,


On behalf of the Philippine Government, please accept our warmest congratulations on your election as President of the 69th Session of the UN General Assembly. I assure you of the Philippines' steadfast support as you provide the leadership and inspiration to the daunting task of continuing the pursuit of a transformative and inclusive post-2015 development agenda.


In choosing the theme for your Presidency, you have positioned people at the center of this development agenda. This people-centered agenda is at the core of President Benigno S. Aquino III's Social Contract with the Filipino People, which is underpinned by a regime of good governance.


Consistent with both the President's Social Contract and the UN's Post-2015 Development Agenda, kindly permit me to present the following issues: progress on the Millennium Development Goals; climate change and Disaster Risk Reduction and Management; the so-called ""Islamic State of Iraq and Syria"" and the Ebola Virus Disease outbreak; peace, security and the rule of law; disarmament; peacekeeping; migration; protection of women and children; and the call for United Nations Reforms. On Progress on the MDGs


Fourteen years ago, a shared vision of a decent and secure life for all our peoples motivated us to adopt the Millennium Development Goals. We all vowed to undertake a mission to fight poverty and disease, grant children of school age access to primary education, improve gender equality, care for mothers and children, provide our communities with safe drinking water, protect our environment from further degradation, and mobilize international partnerships and resources to help those in great need.


Today, based on the latest report on the Millennium Development Goals, our collective efforts brought down the number of people living in extreme poverty by half; provided over two (2) billion people with access to safe drinking water; and achieved success in the fight against malaria and tuberculosis. But with one year to go, much remains to be done.


The Philippines' score card shows that we have made considerable progress in the areas of extreme poverty eradication, under age 5 mortality, the fight against both malaria and tuberculosis, access to safe drinking water, and gender equality. Like many other developing countries, however, we continue to face challenges in other areas.


We have recently taken pause to consider new strategies. We have also realized the importance of strengthening good-quality data collection and analysis as a tool for measuring our Millennium Development Goals and aid us in our decision-making.


A year ago, before this very same Assembly, the Philippines called for a post-2015 development agenda anchored on respect and promotion of human rights, accountable governance, and inclusive development. All our current national efforts are founded on these pillars.


On Climate Change, Disaster Risk Reduction and Management


Mr. President,


The greatest challenge to the Philippines in meeting the Millennium Development Goals was the series of disasters that visited our country. Super typhoon Haiyan, the strongest typhoon to have hit landfall in recorded history, made a significant impact on the modest progress we have achieved in the Millennium Development Goals. This and the disasters in other parts of the world remind us of the urgency in addressing climate change.


Two months ago, we completed a Comprehensive Rehabilitation and Recovery Plan for the Haiyanaffected areas.


The comprehensive plan requires a considerable amount of resources and effort, but the Philippines and its international partners are determined to see this massive rebuilding and rehabilitation plan to full completion. We are resolute in not only building back but building back better.


Once again, let me reiterate the Filipino people's gratitude for the outpouring of assistance from the international community for the victims and survivors of Haiyan. Your response and solidarity were, indeed, timely, overwhelming, and inspiring.


At this time, we look forward to the forthcoming Third World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Sendal, Japan and to the first-ever global Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul, Turkey, during which we hope to share the lessons we learned from Haiyan.


On ISIS and the Ebola Virus Disease outbreak


Mr. President,


Just as the international community mobilized as one in extending help to the Philippines in the aftermath of Haiyan, it should also do so in the case of two present day scourges - the so-called ""Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)"" and the Ebola Virus Disease outbreak.


The Philippines condemns the war crimes and crimes against humanity being perpetrated by ISIS. We have supported Security Council Resolution 2178 on foreign terrorist fighters adopted on 24 September because we believe that resolute and immediate action is necessary to suppress this group. As a responsible member of the international community, the Philippines will do its part in the global efforts to thwart ISIS and their false ideologies.


On the Ebola Virus Disease outbreak, the Philippines recognizes its risks on global health and its impact on development. As such, we will support, based on our capacity, the international community's efforts in arresting the spread of this scourge through the auspices of the World Health Organization.


On Peace, Security and the Rule of Law


Mr. President,


Development efforts are jeopardized by setbacks brought about by threats to peace, security and the rule of law. We must ensure that conflicts do not undermine any development agenda that we pursue. We must rededicate ourselves to the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter, relevant international conventions and agreements to resolve all conflicts peacefully and in accordance With the rule of law.


In this spirit, I am pleased to share the Philippine experience in building peace in Southern Philippines. With the signing of the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro, we are optimistic that peace dividends in the form of investments, jobs, economic opportunities, access to basic services, and infrastructure will finally redound to the benefit of our Muslim brothers and sisters.


We are grateful to the United Nations and the international community for their role in supporting us through the long and challenging journey of this peace process.


As we herald these achievements of peace at home, however, we face the reality of exacerbating tensions in our regional seas. Again, the Philippines has resorted to the rule of law in trying to resolve these tensions.


The Philippines believes the core instrument for resolving maritime disputes is the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea or UNCLOS.


We have invited a State Party to settle our maritime disputes peacefully through UNCLOS including its provisions on dispute settlement, specifically arbitration under Annex 7 of the Convention. However, it has refused to join us and has continued to unilaterally embark on an expansionist claim that violates the legitimate rights of the Philippines and other littoral neighbors under UNCLOS such as their Exclusive Economic Zones and Continental Shelves.


Instead of peacefully resolving the maritime disputes within the framework of UNCLOS, said State embarked on a series of dangerous, reckless and forceful activities in an attempt to impose unilateral change in the maritime status quo of the South China Sea. These unilateral activities escalated the tensions and threatened the peace and stability of the South China Sea. In 2012, after forcibly occupying the tiny rocks of Scarborough Shoal within 126 M (nautical miles) of the Philippine island of Luzon, the aforementioned State refused to abide by a mutual agreement to deescalate tensions by not withdrawing its vessels from the said rocks.


Earlier this year, said State imposed a unilateral moratorium on fishing in some areas of the South China Sea which infringes on the legitimate sovereign rights of the Philippines and other Coastal States to their Exclusive Economic Zones. In the last two years, it has undertaken massive land reclamation activities in Johnson Reef, McKennan and Hughes Reef, Cuarteron Reef and Gaven Reef in the Spratlys.


These unilateral activities, among others, form part of a pattern of forcing a change in the maritime status quo in order to advance a so-called nine dash line position, an expansive claim of indisputable sovereignty over nearly the entire South China Sea, which are in contravention of both the 2002 ASEANChina Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and UNCLOS.


The Philippines supports the Secretary-General's call for States Parties to clearly define and publicize the limits of their respective maritime zones so that Parties will have greater certainty on their maritime spaces.


Mr. President,


UNCLOS provides a viable mechanism to resolve conflicts, one of which is through arbitration. Arbitration is an open, friendly and durable solution to the peaceful settlement of maritime disputes. Arbitration, in defining maritime entitlements, is intended to benefit all.


As such, the Philippines is more determined than ever in its pursuit of all possible means under international law to keep the conflict from escalating and undermining regional peace, security, and stability.


At the 47th ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar, the Philippines proposed the Triple Action Plan or TAP to reduce tensions.


Our Triple Action Plan proposal contains immediate, intermediate and final approaches to address the provocative and destabilizing activities in the South China Sea. It is a positive, comprehensive and constructive framework, which brings together various initiatives that the Philippines and other countries have been advocating on the issue of the South China Sea for the past years.


As an immediate approach, the TAP calls for the cessation of specific activities that escalate tensions in the region, pursuant to paragraph 5 of the 2002 ASEAN-China Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea or DOC. Paragraph 5 calls for (1) the conduct of self-restraint, (2) no inhabiting of uninhabited features including massive reclamation, and (3) handling differences in a constructive manner.


For the intermediate approach to manage tensions until a final resolution is achieved, the Triple Action Plan highlights the need for the full and effective implementation of DOC and the expeditious conclusion of the Code of Conduct or COC.


As a final approach, the Triple Action Plan underscores the need for a settlement mechanism to bring the disputes to a final and enduring resolution anchored on international law.


The Philippines is pursuing such a resolution through Arbitration and believes that the Arbitration decision will clarify maritime entitlements and will pave the way for the full resolution of the maritime disputes in the South China Sea.


These approaches under the Triple Action Plan can be pursued simultaneously. It does not prejudice territorial claims.


We enjoin all to be united in addressing the challenge of resolving this issue in accordance with the rule of law.


On Disarmament


Mr. President,


The Philippines is deeply concerned over the threat of Weapons of Mass Destruction from the Middle East to the Korean Peninsula.


The Philippines has remained firm in its position on the total and complete elimination of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.


The Philippines strongly believes that the Conference on the Establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and All Other Weapons of Mass Destruction should be convened as soon as possible. The Six Party talks on the Korean Peninsula should re-start. We need a successful outcome to the 2015 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference to ensure the credibility of the Treaty.


The Philippines strongly supports the ongoing discourse on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons that has been gaining ground within and outside the UN.


We will continue to lend our voice to calls for nuclear disarmament until we have reached the goal of global zero.


The Philippines also deplores the use of landmines and improvised explosive devices, and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons, which, unfortunately still continue around the world.


On Peacekeeping


Mr. President,


United Nations peacekeeping missions are crucial for international peace and security. The Philippines, through its continuous participation in peacekeeping missions, has shown its steadfast commitment to contribute to this worthy cause.


Let me take this opportunity to thank our partners in the international community for their invaluable assistance in recent incidents involving our Filipino peacekeepers, specifically the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force in the Golan Heights. Our collective action has highlighted the importance that the international community continues to accord to UN peacekeeping.


In the face of grave danger, Filipino peacekeepers have bravely helped to safeguard world peace. They have served with honor, distinction and professionalism in implementing peacekeeping mandates.


We are deeply concerned with the continuing and emerging dangers faced by all U.N. peacekeepers and urge the United Nations and all fellow Member States to ensure that these dangers are addressed comprehensively.


We believe that outstanding operational and tactical issues relating to United Nations peacekeeping must be resolved at the highest levels as soon as possible.


The Philippines reiterates its solid commitment to uphold multilateral peacekeeping, collective security and the rule of law.


On Migration and the Protection of Women and Children


Mr. President,


When we speak of inclusive development, we must take into full account the invaluable contributions that migrant workers make to global development and progress. Their well being is a shared responsibility and the international community's commitment to promoting inclusive societies.


These migrants are especially vulnerable in times of conflict and should not be forgotten. They deserve the complete support and cooperation of the international community in ensuring their safety, security and well-being. For such an important task, all countries - whether receiving, transit or sending - must be fully involved.


We are also alarmed that migrants, particularly women and children, continue to be victims of trafficking. National and international efforts to prevent trafficking, to prosecute traffickers and to assist in the recovery and rehabilitation of victims have to be strengthened.


From a broader perspective, we should fully respect the rights of migrants by according them equal treatment in all countries.


The Philippines will continue to support efforts to protect the basic rights of migrants, to recognize their contributions to development, and to secure for them a place in the inclusive societies that we envision in the post-2015 development agenda.


On United Nation Reforms


Mr. President,


As we discuss and negotiate the best ways to deliver and implement the post-2015 development agenda, we should take concrete action on the proposed UN reforms that have been the subject of years of discussions and dialogues.


The Philippines supports change and reform in the UN to strengthen its ability to meet new demands and deliver its mandate in the most effective, transparent, accountable, and efficient manner.


Reforms should include: a better selection process for the Secretary-General, the President of the General Assembly, and executive heads of the UN; an increase in membership of the Security Council; a review of the use of the veto power in the Security Council; an increased budget for peacekeeping missions; and ways to make full and effective use of partnership across the range of UN activities.


For example, if we were to elect a woman to be the next Secretary General of the United Nations, this would be a powerful signal on gender equality and empowerment. Conclusion Mr. President, As we set the stage to roll out a new set of goals for the post-2015 development agenda, let us not lose track of the equal importance of an enabling political and social environment to support these goals. When conflicts and insecurity endure, when disasters strike, when pandemics break out, when terrorism spreads, when Earth's bounties are confronted with depletion, we face the real danger that our development agenda will fail.


It is our responsibility, as Member States of the United Nations, to exert every effort and to expend every resource at our command, to make the United Nations the instrument for promoting peace, progress and development.


I thank you Mr. President."	2014-09-29
Albert F. del Rosario	UNGA 70	"The Philippines in the United Nations: 

On a Steady Path to Peace and Sustaiable Development


Mr. President, On behalf of the Philippine Government, I express our warmest congratulations on your election as President of the 70t"" Session of the UN General Assembly.


I assure you of the Philippines' support of your leadership Jn charting the course for an energized United Nations about to embark, this historic year, on an ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, our ""plan of action for people, planet and prosperity"" over the next 15 years.


Let me also commend you, Mr. President, in choosing a theme which echoes the fundamental elements that led to the creation of the United Nations. This theme is also at the core of Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino Ill's Social Contract with the Filipino People.


In 1945, when the UN Charter was signed in San Francisco, the 51 Founding Members, including the Philippines, envisioned a future of enduring peace, shared prosperity and a new era of collaboration.


Seventy years later, we have created a meeting place of the world, an experiment in world governance, and a venue where the universal values of equality, tolerance and human dignity prevail.


The United Nations has become a major forum of nations that guarantees the dignity and worth of every person. It has evolved as the main platform of opportunities to fight ignorance, disease, poverty, injustice and extremism.


With all the successes and challenges, praises and pitfalls, the United Nations has not only demonstrated its resilience, but has also affirmed continuing relevance against the backdrop of complex global issues and emerging regional threats to peace and security. Today, the Philippines renews its steadfast commitment to the cause of peace and sustainable development through key priority areas and national positions ranging from climate change and the rule of law, memberships in APEC and ASEAN, disarmament and non-proliferation; to women, peace and security, migration and human trafficking, peacekeeping and UN reform.


THE 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT


Two years ago, at this very forum, the Philippines outlined the five (5) pillars which form part of the building blocks for the new framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development:


First, poverty reduction and social inclusion;


Second, environment sustainability, climate change and disaster risk management;, Third, accountable, responsive and participatory govemance;


Fourth, a fair and stable order based on the rule of law; and


Fifth, peace and security.


During the process of intergovernmental negotiations for the 2030 Agenda, these pillars have guided the Philippines in sharing its experiences in pursuing inclusive growth, on some lessons learned in governance and on the continuing development and security challenges that we face as an emerging economy.


CUMA TE CHANGE AND DISASTER RiSK REDUCTION


Mr. President,


The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the overall global development architecture needs to emphasize strengthening the pillar of Resilience The Philippines only knows too well the urgency of building a climate-resilient economy, being one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world and having experienced, almost two years ago, the devastating impact of Super Typhoon Haiyan, the strongest typhoon to have made a landfall in recorded history.


Given the new normal of mega disasters, the Philippines will continue to play an active role in tackling the issues of climate change, resiliency and disaster risk reduction and management.


The Philippines is the current President of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) and will promote a meaningful outcome in the UNFCCC COP21 in Paris. The international community must adopt a new legally-binding climate agreement that is universal and equitable, one that ensures a bright and low-carbon future for the next generation; and one that addresses the needs of vulnerable states and sectors particularly the poor, women, migrants and indigenous peoples.


On disaster risk reduction and management, the Philippines will be guided by the Sendai Framework for 2015-2030 which recognizes that the State has the primary role in DRRM.


That responsibility, however, should be shared with the local government, the private sector and other stakeholders.


We will support initiatives in the UN that will allow us to work on the four (4) priorities of understanding disaster risk, strengthening risk governance to manage disaster risk, investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience, and ""building back better.""


THE RULE OF LAW


Mr. President,


On maritime disputes in the South China Sea, the Philippines has long placed its faith in the rules and institutions that the international community has created to regulate relations among States. International law serves as the great equalizer among States, allowing small countries to stand on an equal footing with wealthier, more powerful States.


International law is the tie that binds the community of nations together. Without it, the global order can fall into anarchy.


This is why the Philippines, under the administration of President E}enigno S. Aquino Ill, has been a strong advocate of the primacy of the rule of law.


With the growing support from the international community in peacefully resolving disputes in the South China Sea, including through arbitration, the Philippines believes that the final outcome of this arbitration process would pave the way for a settlement of the maritime disputes.


On our dispute with China, a long-time partner and neighbor, we also hope that we will finally see actions that are consistent with Beijing's declarations so that genuine efforts to lower tensions in the South China Sea can succeed and the peaceful settlement of disputes can be obtained.


APEC AND ASEAN: COMPLEMENTING THE UN's WORK


Mr. President,


This year, the Philippines plays host to APEC 2015 with the theme: ""Building Inclusive Economies, Building A Better World.""


As APEC Chair, our second since 1996, the Philippines seeks to mainstream and pursue the following priorities: Investing in Human Capital Development; Fostering Small and Medium Enterprises' Participation in Regional and Global Markets; Building Sustainable and Resilient Communities; and Enhancing the Regional Economic integration Agenda. APEC, both as a process and a platform, continues to positiveBy contribute to the region's economic environment by promoting legal certainty for trade and investment. APEC also complements the global efforts to address challenges to sustainable economic growth through the APEC Strategy for Strengthening Quality Growth, which promotes synergy between APEC's work and the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.


On ASEAN, the ten (10) Member States will be integrating their economies by the end of this year, realizing the vision of One ASEAN Community. We need to ensure that ASEAN, our Member States, partners and the Secretariat, remain fully engaged in the United Nations system.


Indeed, the partnership between ASEAN and the UN has been beneficial to regional peace and stability. As we reaffirmed when ASEAN met with the UN Secretary-General last Wednesday here in New York, we are confident of the UN's continued support for ASEAN centrality and its Pillars.


DISARMAMENT AND NON-PROLIFERATION


Mr. President,


Disarmament and non-proliferation have become more compelling issues for the Philippines given that 10 percent of our population live and work overseas, many in hot spots in the Middle East and Africa.


The Philippines remains firm in its position on the total and complete elimination of nuclear weapons and all other Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).


We will continue to voice our concerns over the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons. We reiterate the need for balanced and immediate implementation of the 64- Point Action Plan of the 2010 NPT RevCon chaired by the Philippines, particularly for the establishment of a Middle East WMD-free zone. We also look forward to the signing and ratification of the Protocol to the Southeast Asian Nuclear Weapons Free Zone (SEANWFZ) by the P-5 states.


On conventional weapons, the Philippines will help sustain the positive momentum created by the Arms Trade Treaty's (ATT) progress, and continue to engage in discussions on small arms and light weapons and improvised explosive devices, particularly as used by armed non-state actors.


WOMEN, PEACE AND SECURITY


Mr. President,


The Philippines shall continue on its path to successfully implement the agenda of Women, Peace and Security by highlighting at this session the important contributions of women in peace negotiations and peace building, and their roles in shaping the narratives of peace.


We will maintain our active roles in calling for the continued implementation of the CEDAW, the Beijing Platform for Action and the Sustainable Development Goals on women, particularly Goal 5 on achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls. Taken together, these instruments are powerful mechanisms for realizing national and international commitments to advance women's roles as enablers of sustainable development.


HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND MIGRATION


Mr. President,


In the negotiations on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Philippines emphasized and will continue to highlight the positive contributions of migrants to sustainable development in countries of origin, transit and destination.


We deeply appreciate the UN's recognition of the Philippines as a model of migration governance because of its comprehensiveness in terms of managed deployment, solid protection component, diaspora engagement and re-integration. Both the UN and the Philippines believe that migration governance is really about giving migrants a ""human face.""


The basic perspective of the Philippine migration management policy focuses on two important considerations: that (1) migration must be a shared international responsibility; and (2) migrants' human rights must be fully respected in all circumstances.


The Philippines will also continue to play an active role on the issue of human trafficking, either as main or co-sponsor of resolutions that recognize the heightened vulnerabiHity to trafficking of women and girls in humanitarian crisis situations and other emergency environments. The Philippines will work with other governments to intensify efforts for the speedy disposition of trafficking cases and strengthening of anti-trafficking mechanisms. The Phi0ippines hopes that through its bienniaH resolution with Indonesia on Violence against Women Migrant Workers, the policies and programs of UN Member States will provide full protection of all migrant women's rights, particularly against discrimination, violence and all forms of sexual exploitation.


PEACEKEEPING


Mr. President,


Since 1963, the Philippines has been a consistent troop-contributor to UN peacekeeping operations. We are committed to and have answered the call of the UN for the deployment of female peacekeepers: i am pleased to announce that there are now 15 Filipino women out of the 161 Filipino peacekeepers in the UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti or MINUSTAH.


Guided by the policy recommendations of the Philippine National Council for UN Peace Operations, we will continue to engage with the UN's Department of Peacekeeping Operations in the deployment of Filipino peacekeepers and support the recommendations of the High-Level Independent Panel on UN Peace Operations to improve the safety and security of our peacekeepers.


UN REFORM


On this 70th Session of the UN, the argument for UN reform is urgent now, more than ever.


The Philippines will continue to push for meaningful discussions on enhancing the role and authority of the UN General Assembly as well as on proposals to rationalize the agenda of the Assembly and its Main Committees.


The Philippines will support calls for continuing the conversations on the much-needed and long-overdue reforms in the Security Council to make the Council more democratic, more inclusive, more transparent and more accountable.


These reforms include urging the Council to provide the General AssemMy a plural number of candidates, especially women, for appointment to the post of Secretary- General, with due regard to regional rotation andgender equality.


Together with other devenoping countries, the Philippines shares the position that a sufficient budget is important for the organization to deliver on its mandates and missions more effectively and with greater accountability.


CONCLUSION


Mr. President,


At the Fourth Session of the UN General Assembly on 20 September 1949, the late great Philippine Statesman, General Carlos P. Romulo, who was just elected President of the UNGA, said that the goal of the United Nations, ""...defined by its Charter, was to make it possible for men to live better lives in larger freedom under a reign of peace, founded on justice and universal respect for law.""


Those words, now, bear greater resonance.


Today, with the honor and privilege to lead the Philippine Delegation, and on behalf of President Benigno S. Aquino Ill and the Filipino people, please allow me to convey these As we prepare the way for our future generations, the Philippines will continue to advocate for three (3) key priorities: eradicating poverty, preventing conflict and promoting the rule of law.


As we reaffirm our faith in the wisdom of the UN Founding Members, we renew our commitment to end the scourge of war, uphold justice and human rights and maintain international peace and security.


As we pursue the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Eet the United Nations continue to serve as the institutional platform, the historical foundation and the moral edifice upon which we manifest humanity's collective dreams, ideals and aspirations.


Thank you."	2015-09-29
Perfecto Yasay Jr.	UNGA 71	"The Philippines and SDGs: 

A Governance Roadmap for Peace, Order and Development


Mr. President,


On behalf of the Philippine Government and the Filipino people, may I convey our warmest congratulations on your election as President of the 71st Session of the UN General Assembly.


May I also commend you, Mr. President, for the choice of a theme that resonates very well among Member States and Partners. The theme ""The Sustainable Development Goals: A Universal Push to Transform Our World"" strongly reaffirms the raison d'etr6 of the United Nations.


The Philippines is one of its Founding Members. For more than 7 decades, our engagement and partnership with the United Nations is a riveting story of our aspirations as a people, born of our colonial past and our independent present. With its central and strategic role, the United Nations remains a relevant and important platform from which all nations can make one decisive push to empower us all to achieve and sustain our development agenda with the interests of our peoples at its core. Partners for Change Today, the Philippines, once again, is privileged to renew its commitment to the cause of peace, security and sustainable development through key priority areas and advocacies identified in the 2030 Agenda. The global action to transform our world illuminates the urgency and importance of our efforts in the Philippines to explore new horizons and break new grounds anchored on our unremitting commitment as a democracy, to the rule of law, to the well-being of our sovereign people, and to remain a responsible partner of the international community.


In engaging the world, the Philippines is committed in partnering for change in the light of our priorities, our needs, and our historical experiences. The Philippines' guiding principles and core values are enshrined in the Constitution that include the sanctity of human life and the inalienable rights that attaches to every person, supremacy of law, freedom, equality, peace, justice, and the right of self-determination. Among these is also the mandate to pursue an independent foreign policy, to promote the paramount national interest.


With our hard-fought and hard-won independence, we zealously value and guard our rights and liberties. Actively at play to prevent abuse and unwanted excesses are the checks and balances of our democratic institutions, from the highly independent three branches of government: the Supreme Court, Congress and the Executive Branch, to the open and free press, and civil society groups committed to guarantee the freedom and prosperity of every Filipino.


These fundamental and time-honored principles and values give rise to the solemn duty of our people to choose their leaders. In turn, the government has the obligation to fervently defend the people's rights and liberties. Reneging on that responsibility places the government at risk of being removed by popular initiatives including People Power - a glorious event in the Philippines which is now admired and remembered throughout the world for peacefully removing a dictator.


Commitment to the Rule of Law


Five months ago, our people, through our nation's democratic principles and processes, elected a new leader. President Rodrigo Roa Duterte triumphed in the democratic elections with an unprecedented and resounding electoral mandate. The Filipino people, proud of their democratic values, tradition and heritage, have spoken. Their vote is the unmistakable call to deepen our democracy where our people will truly be liberated from the shackles of fear, conflict, poverty, and injustice. Their vote is the expressed wish to revitalize the entire country as a sovereign equal among the community of nations. Their sacred ballot cast is the unequivocal and resounding voice for change and the tearing down of antiquated political and economic structures that continue to generate numerous inequalities and perpetuate them, and for the renewal of our communities, and our society, for a life of constancy, dignity, and honor.


In his address to the nation, President Duterte declared that the rule of law and respect for due process shall prevail at all times. Clearly, we will be guided by established norms and procedures under the law to deliver on the strong mandate given to him by the Filipino electorate.


For far too long, the Philippines has been unable to fully advance due to corruption in high and low places, worsening crime situation, and the prevalence of illegal drugs. Our people recognize the peril these evils pose to our development and our democracy.


Corruption has become the breeding ground for the illegal drug trade which seriously threatens the country's peace and order which, in turn, impedes our sustainable development goals. It has torn apart many of our communities, destroyed our families, and snuffed out the hopes and dreams of our people -young and old - for a bright future.


For this reason, we are determined to free the Philippines from corrupt and other stagnating practices, as we eradicate illicit drugs and its manufacture, distribution and use in the country. The rule of law and strict adherence to due process fully governs our campaign against corruption and criminality, including the fight against illegal drugs.


Our firm belief in the supremacy of law is given concrete expression through the state policy enshrined in the Constitution to fully respect human rights and the value and dignity of every person. We even have an independent Human Rights Commission tasked to investigate and prosecute every human rights violations in the country. This national commitment is amplified internationally as the Philippines is a state party to eight of the nine core international human rights conventions. We recognize that a secure, stable, and prosperous Philippines will require a secure and stable rules-based international order to which it must faithfully comply.


With the imperative to forge policies for our people to achieve enduring peace and prosperity, and to once again trust in the government's ability to protect their fundamental rights and freedoms, the President, going into his third month in office, enjoys a 92-percent satisfaction and trust rating from the Filipino people. To him, this trust is sacrosanct; it cannot be breached, under no circumstance must it be compromised.


Our actions, however, have grabbed both the national headlines and international attention for all the wrong reasons.


Consequently, we urge everyone to allow us to deal with our domestic challenges in order to achieve our national goals, without undue interference, and to be among the community of nations that can collectively make a universal push to transform our world and improve the quality of life for all of humanity, including the more than 100 million Filipinos. Have faith in the strong institutions of our democracy. Have faith in our people to defend the freedom and integrity of our country. Have faith in the power of our people as they continue to freely participate, be involved and have a say in the actions and decisions of their democraticallyelected government.


Let me repeat explicitly and unequivocally that the Philippines is committed to the rule of law and the protection of the rights of all Filipinos. With this abiding commitment, our efforts are being pursued within the democratic and legal framework governed by the overriding principle to uphold the dignity of every person, the right to due process, and to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.


For the law to be credible, respected, and effective, it has to be consistent and fair. The full force of the law shall be applied at all times to serve the ends of justice, and not for a selected few. There shall be no double standard, no application of selective justice.


Our campaign to rid the country of criminality, lawlessness and disorder, -- including our all-out war against illicit drugs -- will remain strictly in accordance with the Philippine Constitution and the international norms and human rights treaties and covenants we are party to.


We have not and will never empower our law enforcement agents to shootto- kill any individual suspected of drug crimes. And yet, under our established rules of engagement, our police have the right to defend themselves when their lives are threatened. Extrajudicial killings has no place in our society and in our criminal justice system.


Core Agenda and the Commitment to Our People


Our sustainable goals rest on the fundamentals of development - which is human development. The path of change we seek is grounded on the most enduring of precepts, our own national interest that addresses the immediate needs of the Filipino people.


Our goals are guided by our article of faith that ""we leave no one behind"" in our development strides. We are working hard to ensure that each and every Filipino will be able to keep in step with the overall development pace.


The Philippines continues to enhance the delivery and quality of basic social services to our people anchored on the implementation of what we view as a human approach to development and governance. We benchmark such services to global standards. This is true of our health, education, food, water, and housing services. Environmental preservation, the respect for culture and pursuit of social justice form key components of our national development frameworks.


Since 2013, the Philippines has made public its support for the core pillars of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Philippines is honored to be one of the 22 pioneer countries that volunteered at the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) to share its initiatives in the first year of implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.


Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction


If we are to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals in 15 years, we need to have a risk-informed approach. It is axiomatic to say that frequent and intense natural disasters can negate our gains in reducing poverty and even push back development.


The Philippines is one of the most disaster-prone and vulnerable countries to the adverse effects of climate change due to several years of neglect by countries who have left us far behind in progress because of their irresponsibility and greed at our expense. We reiterate our call for climate justice and the principle of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities in the implementation of obligations under the Paris Agreement.


Commitment to Peace and the International Community


The Philippines will remain a responsible partner of the international community. Our domestic concerns compel us to partner with like-minded countries in the areas of maritime security, counter-terrorism, disaster response, and transnational crime such as but not limited to drug and human trafficking. Our commitment to the rule of law, to peace, to our people, and to our relations with the international community also extends to the recent decision of the Arbitral Tribunal of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague with regard to disputes in the South China Sea.


The decision has upheld the primacy of international law as the cornerstone for a rules-based regional and international order. The Arbitral Award, which is final and binding on all parties, is a clearly established fact and is now part of international jurisprudence in the maritime domain.


We reaffirm our abiding commitment to pursue the peaceful resolution and management of disputes with a view to promoting and enhancing peace and stability in the region. We need to fully respect legal and diplomatic processes, as we explore the best way forward.


We reaffirm the need to enhance mutual trust and confidence. We must not overlook the importance of non-militarization and self-restraint in the conduct of all activities, maintaining freedom of navigation, the full and effective implementation of the DOC and the adoption of an effective Code of Conduct (COC).


Conclusion


Mr. President,


In the last 71 years, the United Nations has demonstrated continuing resilience and relevance in the face of intractable challenges and emerging regional threats, both traditional and non-traditional.


And with the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals, the United Nations has rightly brought development back at the center of global efforts in pursuing peace, security and stability.


The Philippines, as a Founding Member of the United Nations, walks and works with the community of nations in truly transforming our world where the universal values of equality, tolerance and human dignity must prevail. As we reason together in this honored hall of the United Nations, let us together move forward our development goals.


For us to build our future, we must honor our past. As we reaffirm our common humanity, we have to keep faith with one another as we advance our noblest and highest aspirations based on our collective will as we pursue our varying and often disparate national interests.


Despite the odds, and complex challenges, we have to press on, with courage and fortitude for the sake of our peoples and to seize the promise of a better tomorrow for future generations. Let us not forget, to borrow the words of a distinguished member of Humankind, that in our determination to transform the world, it is not enough to see things as they are and ask, 'Why?' Let us all dream of things that never were; and ask 'Why not?""


Thank you, Mr. President."	2016-09-13
Alan Peter S. Cayetano	UNGA 72	"Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called children of GOD. Matthew 5:9


Mr. President, Excellencies,


The path to peace must be walked with patience. To achieve any purpose with othersbe they powers or people, patience is needed. The opposite of patience is impatiencethe cause and aggravation of conflict.

Someone said that Talk, talk is better than war, war. Listening is even better than talking. We must listen to others more than we listen to ourselves. Hopefully we know what we are talking about. But others may know what we do not. We can learn only if we stop talking, and listen.

We may think we know how others can do things better than theyve done it. Maybe our way is more efficient. But the time

 

gained by that efficiency will be time lost convincing others that our way is better, rather than a compromise between our way and theirs.


Real change in the world order necessitates cooperation. Nothing affecting others can be undertaken without their willing involvement, without getting their agreement on the purpose and manner of it. Achieving a shared purpose beyond any single ones ability requires cooperation.


But how else can we get cooperation if not with the patience to explain why it is neededand the equal patience to listen.


This is why we have the United Nations, the largest cooperative endeavor in human history. We use the UN to speak out but equally also to listen. And somehow arrive at a consensus, or at least a modus vivendi on how to proceedin peace and therefore with a greater prospect of progress.


The theme for this years session Focusing on people: striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet captures a promise that everyone who has stood here vowed to fulfill for his people, and the rest of the peoples of the United Nations, as the Preamble of the Charter puts it.


Yet, after 72 years, while much has been achieved, much more has to be done. The promise is still very much a work in progress.


We, the peoples of the United Nations, battle new threats that undermine such success as weve achieved, and frustrate further

 

progress in peace, development and human rights the three pillars of the United Nations.


Your theme, Mr. President, mirrors the Philippines own people- centered agenda as articulated by President Rodrigo Roa Duterte.


President Duterte and The Filipino People are committed to real change, to finally carrying out long needed reforms, to addressing national threats long ignored, protecting the human rights of all Filipinos, while doing our part in attaining regional peace and stability.


We remain true to our obligations under the international treaties we have ratified. We have made much sacrifices and continue to be willing to make sacrifices.


The Philippines integrates the human rights agenda in its development initiatives for the purpose of protecting everyone, especially the most vulnerable, from lawlessness, violence, and anarchy; particularly families, women and children, the poor, indigenous people, migrant workers, the elderly, and persons with disabilities.


This is why we have a massive campaign to restore the rule of law by fighting corruption, crime and illegal drugs. We owe it to the 10 million Filipinos working overseas to keep their children and family safe. We owe this to the all Filipino Families.

 

The very principle of The Responsibility to Protect must encompass first and foremost the vast majority of peaceful law- abiding people who must be protected from those who are not. It is for their safety and sustenance that states exist, and for which governments and leaders are responsible.


President Duterte said fewest words and made least promises in the campaign because he listened. He listened and he heard what none of the other candidates would listen to. The vast majority of Filipinos felt vulnerable in their lives and livelihoods, unsafe in the rising drug-driven criminality that threatened those least able to protect themselves. They were also those past governments had least protected: poor and ordinary folk.


The Philippines comprehensive campaign against illegal drugs is necessary instrument to preserve and protect the human rights of all Filipinos, and never an instrument to violate any individuals or groups human rights.


War vs. Illegal Drugs


It was noted in this hall, that all sovereign nations must uphold two core sovereign obligations: to respect the interests of their own people and the sovereignty of other nations. This is true as much in bi-lateral relations between sovereign countries, as when they combine multilaterally on some common decision or action. The Philippines is a sovereign country. Indeed, it was the first subject nation to win its independence however short-lived, thereby earning the honor of being the First Republic in Asia. It expects  that  sovereignty  to  be  respected,  and  that  its

 

democratically-elected governments assessment of threats and how to go about addressing them shall be accorded preeminence among nationsor at least the benefit of their doubt.


We prize sovereignty in all its aspects. We acknowledge the wisdom, and borrow the words here spoken: All responsible leaders have an obligation to serve their own citizens first. In keeping with that obligation, it is a states duty to protect human life, human dignity, and human rightsfrom aggression by other states, terrorism from non-state actors, and the destruction of societies and families from criminal networks trafficking in drugs, people and arms.


As a responsible leader, the Philippine president launched a vigorous campaign against the illegal drug trade to save lives, preserve families, protect communities and stop the countrys slide into a narco-state. An epidemic that would spell the end of sovereignty in any meaningful sense.


As of August 2017, the drug trade had penetrated atleast 24,848 barangays. This is 59% of the total of 42,036 of the smallest government units spanning our archipelago, the ones directly in touch with our people. Where is sovereignty in a country where vast numbers are addicted to drugs and enslaved to their suppliers?


To be sure, drug addiction calls for cure and not chastisement. When the President showed his fierce determination to end the drug menace, 1.3 million drug users turned themselves in. But the neglect of the drug problem by previous governments has left the

 

current one hard pressed to rehabilitate them all. We are thankful that generous souls at home and abroad are building centers all around the country.


While drug addiction calls for rehabilitation, drug trafficking surely calls for stern measuresthough always consistent with the rule of law. The President has and will always have zero-tolerance for abusive cops, as time will show.


But accusation before investigation is not proof. Nor is it fair. Abuses have occurred and mistakes have been made, tragic ones for sure. While one abuse is one too many, still the abuses are far less than the imaginary numbers of partisan accusers and publicity seekers. The drug trade has penetrated even law enforcement. And yet we are getting a message that the best way to stop abuses in the antidrug campaign is to stop the campaign and live with drugs instead.


But we cannot live with drugs because drugs will not let us live. We can no more live with drugs than with terrorism, which, the United Nations admits, and as we have discovered is funded by the drug trade. This has created the new phenomenon of criminal insurgency.


In the century before last, a huge and well-populated Asian country was enslaved by a maritime power which flooded it with drugs.


We welcome this opportunity to address the international communitys concerns and correct the perceptions gleaned from

 

media reports that deny the real scale of the problem as if denial is a solution. The problem is huge and we will not reduce it in our imagination because we dare not face it in reality.


Appeasement emboldens evil. We counsel patience but delay will make the problem bigger until it is beyond containment and control. Indeed, as we have heard in this hall, When decent people and nations become bystanders, the forces of destruction only gather power and strength. We will not slide down the slope of complacency, and of willful ignorance of the threat to our country and our people posed by the drug trade.


Counterterrorism and Violent Extremism


In the past four years, we have seen the rise of the Islamic State and how it has been able to spread its nihilistic ideology beyond Iraq and Syria to become a serious threat to the world.


We should hold no illusion that the threat posed by the Islamic State will be over with the collapse of its self-proclaimed caliphate in Iraq and very soon in Syria. Rather, we should all be ready to confront a very potent threat that has spread to other parts of the world.


In the Philippines, we have discovered the intimate and symbiotic relationship between terrorism vis--vis poverty and the illegal drug trade. These terrorists were somehow able to bring together an assortment of extremists, criminals, mercenaries and foreign fighters who attempted but failed to take control of Marawi. This

 

was part of their grand plan to establish in Southeast Asia an extension of their shattered caliphate in the Middle East.


The Armed Forces of the Philippines shall regain full control of Marawi from Islamic State-inspired terrorists. Their protracted hold on their last several square meters of the city is largely a result of superior arms illegally obtained, and the presence of civilian hostages used by them as human shields. There is also the governments forbearance to unleash greater force so as to avoid collateral loss of life. The fight has been terrible but the effort has been patient and done with care to spare the innocent. Theres been less talk and more listening to those with the most at stake in the struggle: the people of Marawi. The disturbance will be over soon and the rebuilding of Marawi will begin shortly.


Terrorism is a global problem that no country can tackle alone; although here at the UN it was noted with some admiration that Filipino families outside the conflict zone quickly absorbed most of the 200,000 displaced civilians. Our main disaster preparedness is compassion. The Filipino family system is strong and cooperation is a Philippine tradition: help from fellow Filipinos is always at hand. While the main burden is borne by our government and people, and all the risks are taken by our soldiers, we are thankful for such assistance as the international community has extended. Thank you are dear friends for helping when we needed it most.


The Philippines welcomes the creation of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Office to bring into a cohesive whole the work on counterterrorism by Member States and the UN. It will be a

 

sharing of experiences and sober reflections rather than of blind anxieties. That way lies real results.


Rule of Law


As a founding member of the UN, the Philippines has been a strong advocate of the rule of law. We uphold the core of the UN mission - to draw upon the strength and sovereign equality of its members to achieve their common goals.


Mr. President,


Centuries ago, the ambition for land to take invited long and terrible wars. The battle has shifted to the seas, hence the need to affirm our commitment to UNCLOS, as the international law governing the rights and responsibilities of States Parties in their use of the worlds oceans.


The issues are numerous, intertwined and complex. Territorial claims, Sovereignty rights, security and protection of marine life and resources, to name a few.


Dialogue, building trust and promoting cooperation to address issues of concern is the way forward in addressing maritime disputes.


The Philippines, as ASEAN Chairman this year, looks forward to commencing negotiations on the long-overdue code of conduct in West Philippine Sea/South China Sea. We thank the individual

 

ASEAN states and China for their utmost cooperation in this endeavor.


Again in this work, patience, a lot of listening, and willingness to work with rather than against each other, is essential.


We live in a global community and we are all citizens of the world. Today, our social contract is no longer confined to the nation state. In our region, we exert efforts to build bridges and not walls, to emphasize commonalities and not differences, to think less that we are Filipinos, Thai, Indonesian, Japanese, Koreans, Chinese and think more of ourselves as Asians. Beyond being Asians we are global citizens, the people of the United Nations.


HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW


Human rights and the dignity of every person is the main pillar of the United Nations. So it is for the Philippines. As a very spiritual people we are united in believing that man was created in GODs image. That there can be no compromise on human rightsof those who break the law and surely, too, of those who are their victims. We also believe in accountability, not least in the practical conviction that as we sow so shall we reap.


We should never tolerate human rights abuses but neither should we tolerate misinformation, fake news on and politicization of human rights, for these undermine our collective efforts as the United Nations to uphold the universality of human rights and dignity of human life.

 

But why debate security versus human rights? Security and human rights are not incompatible. Indeed, the first is our duty to the other. Without security, the most basic human rights, to life and safety, are constantly under attackfrom terrorism, criminality, drug and human trafficking.





PEACE AND SECURITY


Much has been said about ASEAN. Words like cooperation, consultation and consensus are identified with it. Critics have remarked on the slowness of ASEANs way of proceeding. Yet slow as ASEANs progress has been, that progress has been solid, substantive and irreversibleprecisely because of the patience with which it was made; thereby proving that consensus- based organizations work better.


Five decades ago, Southeast Asia was marred by conflicts, and all previous attempts at Southeast Asian regionalism proved extremely difficult. Our different cultures and differing ideologies and political systems only reinforced this pessimistic outlook.


Fifty years hence, the ASEAN miracle prevails with greater political and economic prospects that have gripped global interest. ASEAN has overcome the divisions, fears, and hostilities of the past. We have used regional cooperation to promote growth, development and integration and peaceful settlement of disputes.

 

Today, the Philippines patiently builds stronger relationships with the international community through the ASEAN and the United Nations. We remain a friend to all and an enemy to noneto bridge, to build, a more peaceful, secure and stable world.


SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT


There is no development without peace, and no peace without development. This is what the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provides. It serves as the template of the Philippine Development Plan called Ambisyon Natin 2040 or Our Ambition 2040.


While the Philippines has experienced unprecedented economic growth, we are adopting measures to make growth more inclusive by massive poverty alleviation programs, creating more jobs, driving innovation, making quality education universally available. Relevant education that imparts training and skill building to make people resilient in changing markets, building greater trust in government with the hope for result of raising tens of millions of Filipinos from poverty.


There is a link between increasing poverty, corruption and a deteriorating environment. President Rodrigo Roa Duterte seeks to reverse this linkage by addressing the adverse effects of climate change  to which the Philippines is most vulnerable  through disaster risk reduction and through strict implementation of laws protecting the environment.

 

To honor the immense sacrifices of our 10 Million Filipinos abroad  and all other migrant workers of the world making huge sacrifices so that their families may have a better life  we press on with our advocacy of the Global Compact on Migration. As we seek to improve conditions for foreign nationals living and working in the Philippines, we advocate the fundamental concept of loving our neighbor as we love ourselves. We call on the UN to elevate migration in its agenda.


Disarmament and Non-Proliferation


If we listen to each other, we will hear the same thing. We have no need for nuclear weapons. There is absolutely no benefit in another cold war, neither in an arms race. We want nuclear weapons to be a thing of the past and we do not want an arms race anywhere in the world.


On July 7, the Philippines joined 121 other member-states in securing our world from weapons of mass destruction by adopting the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Three days ago, I signed the Treaty. The Philippines calls on Member States with nuclear weapons to likewise sign on. We can only have a safe world if we get rid of all nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. By doing so, we save succeeding generations from the scourge of war which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind.


The Philippines, on its own, and as this years chair of ASEAN, has expressed its grave concern over the growing tensions in the Korean Peninsula because of the Democratic Peoples Republic

 

of Koreas missile test launches and detonations. The Philippines joins the call on the DPRK to put a stop to its provocations, which bring us closer to an unimaginable scenario: a war to end all wars because no one will be left to fight new ones.



CONCLUSION


Let me end where I began and call again for patience, for listening and for cooperation, focused always on the wellbeing of, to quote the Charters preamble, We, the peoples of the United Nations.


Let us listen to each other as we are the people of the United Nations. Our Faith and destiny as human beings of this planet are intertwined.


In a situation like the present, where every finger in and around the Korean Peninsula is on a trigger, every eye is out for a wrong move, the likelihood of a surprise attack is virtually zero. In that situation, no one can be caught by surprise and unprepared to strike back.

So what is there to lose by going on talking and listening until the very last moment?


Patience, listening as much as talking, cooperation among friends and even enemies: these are the signposts on the path of peace.


Peace is about peoples. No people and no country can have a national identity if there are no others who can tell the difference.

 

Without peopleseach one different yet all the same in their being and in the good they seekit is impossible to imagine the world. To utter the phrase the world means a planet with many peoples sharing it.


All of us are pieces of a giant puzzle. We seek to be completed by being pieced together thereby creating a whole, beautiful picture. In a war of all against all, of everyone each against the other, the last man standing is not at peace he is but a single piece. He is not the victor he is simply alone.


Thank you Mr. President."	2017-09-23
Alan Peter S. Cayetano	UNGA 73	"There once was a widow who suffered an injustice. She went to a judge and told him, Judge, I have suffered an injustice. Give me justice. The judge did nothing, so the next day she went to his office. Still he did nothing, so she went to his house during breakfast time and knocked on the door and said, Judge, give me justice. Still nothing happened. Finally, she waited for him at night before dinnertime and still he would not see her. So, she went at midnight and knocked on his door and woke him up. Finally, the judge went out and told her, You know, maam, I do not fear God, nor do I fear man, but because of your persistence, I will give you justice.


We all grew up with stories, anecdotes and parables  stories that give us hope, build our character and spark our determination to change the world. We are told those stories at home, in schools and in places of worship. Thus, we come out of adolescence and enter adulthood with an idealism that makes us convinced that we can change the world, that we are here to unite and not to divide, that we are here to heal and not to hurt.


That is the same spirit of idealism that we feel the first time we enter the United Nations. Unfortunately, as time goes by, many, if not most, of us are changed by the world. We become victims of pragmatism rather than champions of idealism. As things get complicated and struggles get more difficult, we are tempted to simply continue doing what is already being done and accept that we cannot solve the problem. When that happens, we settle for a statement from the majority rather than a broad consensus on how to actually solve the problem.


The story reminds us that persistence is good, but it does not mean that we should be repetitive and simply keep doing the same thing. Albert Einstein defined stupidity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Certainly there is no stupidity in the United Nations, yet a tendency to just keep doing the same thing seems to plague us all. Trying new things is a challenge. It might or might not work, but we should not be afraid of trying, nor should we be afraid of failing. What we should fear is stagnation  that we as a community of nations end up accepting failure and making ourselves feel better by doing something, even if that something is precisely the same thing that failed to address the issues or solve the problems in the first place.


The good news is that there is persistence in what we call hope and idealism, in the aspiration of wanting to change the world. We teach our children to love God and to love our neighbour. But do we actually practice what we preach? So much inhumanity around the world has been done in the name of God, and so little is being done at times for our neighbours.


We live in a world that is fast becoming bigger, but also constantly getting smaller. From families to clans, to tribes to a federation of tribes that we call a nation, now we are but one global village. And with tools like the Internet and social media, everything is known and communicated in real time. Nowadays we are all neighbours, all members of the same global community. We rise up together; we suffer together. Being connected to each other all the time has transformed the world into a global community, and we are all citizens of this world.


Today, our social contract is no longer confined to our nation State. We should therefore exert efforts to connect, to emphasize commonalities and not differences, to think less that we are Filipinos, Americans, Chinese, French or Russians, and to think of ourselves more as global citizens, the people of the United Nations. Yes, it is true that we need not always act with a united front, and we do not always have to act as a community. But neither can we ignore the fact that there are many problems that can be solved only by a united global community. These can be issues relating to protecting the environment, extreme weather conditions, poverty and inequality, rule of law, countering terrorism or violent extremism: those are problems or challenges that we can only solve together. Together we can find pragmatic idealism, which will give us hope and the momentum to do more.


It is written: Love thy neighbour. Migration is a reality. It is a fact. It is something that will continue to exist and even to grow. Issues relating to migration cannot be swept under the rug, but should be discussed openly, frankly and thoroughly. The global compact for migration is a huge step in the right direction, and that huge step will be even bigger if we can get everyone on board.


Again, Love thy neighbour, we are told. That seems like a simple command, and yet in a complex world it is sometimes hard to carry out or implement. That is why Filipinos thank Pope Francis, and we thank Secretary-General Guterres and all the countries thathave led and stood by the global compact. We thank migrants around the world for inspiring us to have the first compact negotiated at the intergovernmental level to cover, in a holistic and comprehensive manner, all dimensions of international migration.


The Philippines, under the leadership of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, is one with the United Nations in being uncompromising on the issues of the rule of law, just and equitable peace, which leads to order, development and prosperity, and the protection of each and every human beings rights. As a sovereign and democratic country led by a duly elected President, we are on track to salvage our deteriorating country from becoming a narco-State or a State held hostage by the rich and powerful, who ignore the plight of the poor, powerless and marginalized.


The hunger for change, peace, and law and order is genuine. There is passion to improve our economy, so that the more than 10 million Filipinos abroad can choose whether to work at home or abroad and not be forced by poverty or the lack of quality jobs to go abroad to find high-paying jobs at the cost of leaving their country and separating from their families. Those who stay at home can, at the very least, live a safe and comfortable life.


We may somehow and sometimes differ in how we express ourselves; yet that should not be interpreted as turning our backs on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. On the contrary, the Philippines and President Duterte are instituting all of those reforms so as to be able to protect the rights of every single Filipino and every single human being living in the Philippines  yes, the rights of all Filipinos and all human beings, if that is at all possible. But in cases where we have to choose between protecting the rights of a law-abiding citizen and the law enforcer versus the drug lord or criminal who seeks to kill and destroy, it is clear that we will protect the former  the law enforcer and the law-abiding citizen. Would Members of the United Nations not do the same? Which country, which leader would not do the same? Who would not protect their citizens and their law enforcers?


Challenges will always be there, but so will hope! Hope leads to faith, and faith combined with action produces miracles. The United Nations is the place, the venue of great opportunity for adding action to our faith and for changing the world for the better. That is, of course, provided we can transcend our personal and sometimes national interest for the interest of the global community or, simply put, work for the greater good. Faith without action is dead. The United Nations is not a place to bury our dead; it is a place to rise up, to resurrect our hopes and to dream of a better world.


The President of the General Assembly, Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garcs, provides us with hope and something to aspire to, as seen in this years theme: Making the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. Making the United Nations relevant to all is difficult. It is a dream; yet it is a dream worth fighting for. The Filipino people will remain persistent in our quest for peace, order, development and prosperity, and in the quest for a safe and comfortable life for all those living in the Philippines. We will continue to have faith but will add actions to our faith, and we will continue to love our nation and not only preach but actually do what we preach.And finally, we would like to close our statement by expressing our sincere and profound gratitude to all the countries and peoples that have assisted us, stood with us and lifted us up when we needed it most. God bless all present. God bless all the peoples of the United Nations."	2018-09-29
Teodoro L Locsin Jr.	UNGA 74	"The Philippines congratulates the President on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. He has our full support. We also congratulate Her Excellency Ms. Mara Fernanda Espinosa Garcs, President of the Assembly at its seventy-third session, for her success in making the United Nations relevant for all at a time of determined efforts to make it irrelevant. Working here at the United Nations, I witnessed that her heroic efforts brought off brilliant effect. It was a privilege to serve with her.


Since the first session of the General Assembly, in 1946, States Members of the United Nations have gathered annually to pledge their commitment to peace, because that is what the United Nations was founded for after the Second World War. Peace first; the big words and ideas proposing ways to create the right environment to make peace meaningful and thrive, or not, are secondary. But we know that peace comes for sure when the fighting stops, not just long enough to wash the dead and bury them but long enough for survivors to start over. To be sure, they never get back what they loved and lost, but they start again with what little is left, because hope springs eternal. We are in the United Nations to sustain that hope and fight off despair.


As we approach the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, predictions are rife with the demise of multilateralism. One piece of evidence proffered is the democratic election of strong Governments that talk tough and brush aside the demands of the United Nations  well-meaning for the most part  about how Governments should do their job more kindly, by standards more honoured in the breach than the observance in the West. Weak Governments, unable to protect their people, appear desirable because they make the case for multilateral intervention at the prompting of conscience of course  but sometimes at the unilateral prompting of great Powers or violent or civil non-State actors.


Strong Government is better. That is why Government was invented, to get things done, but always consistently constitutional in its actions. Firm is good and severity is justified, but all within the law. Far from dying or dead, the United Nations is alive and strong, although only as much as its Members make it. Most United Nations States Members are democracies. And do not say there are democracies and democracies. All democracies are pretentions in some degree. The growing electoral trend towards strong Governments does not change their democratic character. That trend proves the United Nations has achieved one of its key goals for peace  the spread of democracy  because they lean more to peace than war, although the jury is still out on that one.


Some in the rest of the world might not like the electoral result, but the people back home are happy with their choice. It is theirs to make and regret, but it is not the United Nations to decide. The next election might change it more to ones liking, or not. Still, we are warned of States eroding multilateralism by each asserting too much sovereignty. But in what respect? Perhaps by insisting on carrying out a States defining duty to protect its population against harm by any means efficient to achieve that purpose. That may cause dismay among the civil in society  civil society is free to complain. Better yet, they should run for public office to gain legitimacy and be able to do something about it. But the United Nations is not free to interfere with the State in its defining function of protecting its citizens and stamping out threats.


In a reflective mood, my President asked me,When did it happen that the rule of law no longer means the rule of law but the rules of crime. When did the presumption of innocence, which attaches only after arrest and arraignment, attach itself to the perpetrator the instant he is caught? That makes it legally impossible to suspect, let alone arrest him on probable cause. There are no more suspects, only victims of human rights violations when enforcing the law for the protection of citizens.


All I could say was, I do not know. I just do not know.


The nations herein united should not let this platform be used to threaten others with accountability for taking a tough approach to crime, instead of taking seriously what they cannot, the Western proposition that the sure-fire way to end crime is to legalize it. Then it is no longer criminal. Well, that works after a fashion, not to punish lawbreakers but sit down and talk them out of repeating the only thing at which they are any good  crime. That is something I learned at the Munich Security Conference on human trafficking  not as the evil it is but as a regular job. The pay is not bad. Traffickers know only how to traffic  anything, as a German expert said, and they will not stop, because they cannot stop, until they are stopped.


The threat to multilateralism comes as much from its own vain attempts to usurp State functions as from unilateralists attempts to oust it from the world stage and return us to the anarchy of the pre-war period out of whose ashes the United Nations was born. Talk before fighting is what the United Nations is about. And if talk fails, talk some more. War is really the ultima ratio regis.


In the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) we are still talking; knowing that talk, so long as we give up nothing vital in the process, does not hurt. We are negotiating a code of conduct with China in the South China Sea. We have had incidents with swarming Chinese ships and lost a reef in our Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). But, so far, we have had no interference in the joint exploration and development of oil and gas in areas within our EEZ, but China claims them as well. I crafted a memorandum of understanding on oil and gas, which China accepted, that allows us to move forward without the slightest compromise or diminution of our respective sovereign and international rights. But who can tell?


The code of conduct is a code of reality, the reality of the proximity of the soon-to-be biggest economy in the world in one place, with a commensurate industrial war-making capacity. But war is a totally remote possibility. All parties have built so much and achieved such material progress that none of us, or any outside Power, will risk losing the richest market in the world. It is therefore a code of live and let live with China  until it is not. We have all asked of each other, ASEAN members and China, for mutual restraint and complete respect for the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, to which all of us are signatories, binding ourselves unqualifiedly thereto, including China. Then it is something else. We will come to that and cross that bridge when we get there, maybe.Multilateralism has come into question because it allows itself to be bent to unipolar purposes  or worse, to the purposes of non-State actors  against multilateralisms reason for being, namely, the protection and safety of the weak and many, against the strong and few.


Multilateralism is not owned by a select club of Member States. It is by and for all, or no one. The Philippines believes that the United Nations stands on the single pillar of the aggregated sovereignties of its Members. That is parlous but stable enough for a time. The United Nations is a collection of sovereign States, not a sovereign collective itself. It is only as effective as its Members make it. It harnesses sovereignties, not for some against others but to common purposes of peace and productive cooperation.


Sovereignty is as much a duty of care as it is an assertion of unlimited freedom of action. In the United Nations the two combine in the willing assumption of that duty on the part of States towards the international order to ensure peace and the well-being of we, the peoples of the United Nations. The Philippines is a proud founding Member of the United Nations, present at the creation even before we were independent. Carlos P. Romulo proclaimed in 1946 at the General Assembly during its first session:By the circumstances of our birth as a free and independent State, we are committed to the aims and purposes of the United Nations. (A/PV.41, p. 819)


Even as our State was cloaked with sovereignty at birth, so was it saddled with the duty, commensurate with that power, to use it only for good.


Our engagement with the United Nations has been in the belief that the United Nations work must reflect the realities of the times, so as to be practical and useful in achieving the aspirations of we, the peoples of the United Nations  peoples as they are, in the real situations they are in, and not the Member States. The United Nations does not work with abstractions, that is for politicians and professional do-gooders. Only then can the United Nations stay relevant and become effective. The aspiration of the vast majority of my people today, call them short-sighted or just plain wrong, is to be free of drugs and safe from crime. Is that so hard to understand? It seems impossible for some to accept. But the cartel can be persuasive in kind, if not in reason. The United Nations is the core of the multilateral global order. As long as the United Nations exists, none can trumpet the end of multilateralism. But it must be a United Nations strengthened and capacitated in its every Member, so that all, collectively, may achieve its aim of peace and safety.


An increasingly complex security and global situation, which is to say an anarchy beyond that of the inter-war years between States, but which now includes non-State actors, both violent and civil, requires the Security Council to adapt, reform and expand its membership, but only of formal States  throw everything in the pot and nobody can eat it. It needs to be representative, even at the risk of stasis, and democratic, for the sake of legitimacy. It cannot let itself be paralysed when the situation screams for humanitarian action. It must be prompt, yet circumspect and sharply focused, when it takes action, attempting no more than to end the carnage, with just enough rebuilding to enable reason and compassion, not hysteria and the usual self-dealing, to find a good way forward. No one expects the best.


We ask the Security Council to provide the General Assembly with multiple candidates  especially women  for the post of Secretary-General, with due regard to gender balance and regional rotation. Something is not right with its mindset and system if, after nearly 75 years, the United Nations has failed to have a woman Secretary-General. Do not blame it on the vote. The vote goes only as far as the Security Council lets it. From my experience, women know best how to build, men how to tear down.


Central to United Nations reform is funding. The Philippines is deeply concerned with the United Nations deteriorating financial situation. States look to the United Nations to implement their priority agenda  peace and security, of course, humanitarian assistance foremost, along with human rights, and lately sustainable development, climate action, migrants and refugees. But States will not provide it with the means to meet those mandates. They come to complain about what they expect from the United Nations, but step down from the rostrum without committing what all States can spare, which is far more than even the poorest actually contribute. Almost all the countries of the world can afford to give more to the United Nations, as I know all Governments have the capacity to do so if they are careful not to waste and steal at home what they can well afford to give to the United Nations.


Some can give more money to peacekeeping, others to personnel. No country can take the lions share of credit there: they all wear the same uniform, with the same badges and the same Blue Helmets. They bleed the same colour and give up their last breath like any other. But the United Nations itself must engender trust in its use of funds. The Secretary-Generals financial reform proposals would do well to uphold accountability, transparency and sustainability. The public is awash with stories of fiscal irresponsibility.


In 2015, with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we vowed to end poverty. The incidence of poverty in the Philippines fell from 27 per cent to 21 per cent from 2015 to 2018. But, as my President says, the important number is the 6 million Filipinos who are still very poor. It can be done, and it has been done on a far-greater scale than anyone thought possible. The new China lifted 800 million out of utter poverty in 20 years into what is, by any economic indicator, a real middle class. Aligned with the SDGs, our development plan points in the direction of achieving the aspirations of the Filipino people. Their aspirations are no different than those of any other people or nation: getting out of poverty, attaining a comfortable lifestyle, feeling secure about the future, especially for ones children, and being safe by stopping crime, especially drug dealing, which strikes at the victims reason and soul.


I know that drug dealing falls somewhere between race, religion, political belief and gender as something to be equally protected. Admittedly, the drug experience is a bit religious. Therefore, prohibiting it is a crime against humanity up there with the others. But drugs are the reason my Government was elected by a landslide  a mandate that has only grown to 80 per cent because of unceasing criticism. In defending it, the public now own it. But that, as I said, is the problem with democracy: you cannot pick and choose the winner based on your delicacy. It depends entirely on the vote. The one with the most votes wins, while the others  more to ones taste  lose.


Whatever the phraseology adopted to express them, those aspirations are not captured by measuring poverty based solely on income per capita. To truly gauge the progress of our strategies, we have to stop reporting the wrong metric. That is why we have begun to use the Multidimensional Poverty Index. Education is how people lift themselves out of poverty. It does not happen by itself. Philosophers are poor. Charity and social programmes are how we, as individuals and Governments, lift them out faster. Even more Filipinos received basic education this year, with over 27 million enrolled. Over 600,000 out-of-school youth and adult learners are benefiting from an alternative learning system. Tuition is free in State-run colleges, universities and technical and vocational institutions, at both the national and local levels. Tuition is tightly controlled in private institutions.


I urge all States to implement the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. It is telling that advocates of multilateralism conveniently leave out issues of migration. Migration is as multilateral as it gets. Migration is the pervasive reality today. The positive contribution of migrants fosters growth in countries of origin by remittances and countries of destination by industriousness. Migrant labour raises great cities out of deserts and mans the ships that enable global trade. Migrant health workers care for the sick, the children and the elderly, giving to strangers as much care as they gave their own loved ones back home. Sure, they are paid  and for that we are grateful to the host countries of our migrant peoples. Migrants themselves are grateful for the love that is sometimes returned, and sad when they are hurt instead.


Climate change  or, as Secretary-General Guterres calls it, the climate crisis  is the defining development issue of our time. Failure to address it nullifies all other endeavours in the long run. As one economist puts it, climate change matters so much for poverty: it is the poorest who are, and will be, hit earliest and hardest. John Maynard Keynes was prophetic: in the long-run we are all dead.


Climate change has brought my country  already one of the most vulnerable countries to disasters  extreme weather events of increasing recurrence and strength. Disasters are the reverse of God: they can make nothing out of something already there, built with great sacrifice. They wipe out socioeconomic gains like an eraser wipes the lesson off the blackboard at the end of the school day. Disasters do more  they reverse economic growth, so that we must start again not just from nothing, but with far less strength and spirit to try again. If climate action does not measure up to what is needed, we all face the same fate, that is, a diminished existence, then extinction altogether. But those who are most to blame will suffer less and much later than those who are least at fault.


We already have the global frameworks to address poverty, sustain development and combat climate change. Let us just do it. To borrow from Kung Fu Panda, Enough talk; lets fight. The Secretary-General urges us to actually plant trees rather than plan some more to plant them. I think he is fed up.


When President Corazon Aquino addressed the General Assembly in 1986, after her peaceful People Power Revolution, she said, [p]erhaps it is only the tragedy of conflict that teaches us the true value of peace (A/41/PV.5, p. 11). Everything we have, such as it is, everything we work for, everything we wish and strive for  indeed, the world as it is, with much to be desired and the better world we think we can make  will all be erased in an instant by nuclear war. We must eliminate that possibility  and we have tried. The universal ban on nuclear weapons was overwhelmingly adopted at the United Nations and swiftly ratified back home, except in the Philippines, for bureaucratic reasons no one can divine unless they work in Government. Let us not wait for conflict to make us value the peace we have. Let us hope that President Cory Aquino is proved wrong and that we will learn by reading and recollection, rather than living through our violent mistakes all over again.


Terrorism, with its links to drug trafficking and organized crime, is the most pressing threat to us all. The fight to retake the city of Marawi, which left it looking like Swiss cheese, was triggered by an attempt to serve a warrant of arrest for drug trafficking on the leader of an Islamic jihad. Some would argue that we should have just let him get on with his business. Unfortunately, my President will not oblige. He wants to eliminate the drug trade. I know this is terrible  where will we get our fix?


Peace is out of the hands of peacemakers  it is entirely in the hands of lawbreakers, who have attained a level of organization far superior to poor States like mine. The violent initiative lies entirely with them. But what lies with us is decency. It is in the way we fight, the way we protect, the way we defeat our enemies with arms when we are attacked with arms. We fight with the truth when attacked with lies, and will do so always and forever  all Constitutions mandate it  with only victory in mind and refusing anything less. Compromise throws away the advantage gained in a fight for survival, giving the other side time and space to recover and rally. But the fight must always be fought with a decent regard for the civilized opinion of humankind.


The fact that the United Nations endures after nearly 75 years is an affirmation of the worlds abiding desire for peace in spite of its failures, which are broadcast, and the dispiriting silence that greets its many successes. With successes, continuing challenges and unceasing criticism, the United Nations has demonstrated its resilience and affirmed its continuing relevance, which cannot be doubted given the alternative: the terrible wars out of which the United Nations was born. Shifting political realities, successive power configurations and the increasing confused nature of global realities should not make the United Nations change its character and goals of peace and democracy, sustainable development, if possible, and climate action for our sake and our childrens. For Gods sake, they are already screaming at us. They see what is there while we refuse to  none so blind, indeed. Those grim realities teach no values, they only urge surrender by compromise. That is unacceptable to the community of civilized nations. There can be no world order other than the one established with the United Nations as its guardian.


As a sovereign country, the Philippines renews its commitment to the ideals of the United Nations  to end the scourge of war, to uphold justice and, yes, human rights, starting with the right of the many who are good, to be safe and protected from the bad, and to maintain peace and amity among the nations under this one roof  united."	2019-09-28
Rodrigo R. Duterte	UNGA 76	"Mr. President,


I congratulate you on your election and welcome your Presidency of Hope. Indeed, that is what we need in these challenging times.


For nearly two years now, the pandemic has upended our lives. The climate crisis has worsened, inequalities have deepened, and the geopolitical balance is in a state of dangerous flux.


Certainly, these are complex problems. But one thing is clear  they all hit the poor the hardest. Injustice is the common thread that ties these issues together. When I spoke before this august body last year, I said that how we address these issues will define our future.


From what I have seen, that future will likely be one of inequality  where the poor plays catch-up with the rich, with no hope nor chance of ever succeeding in closing the gap.


We cannot, in all conscience, allow this to happen. An unjust order is inherently volatile.


We have to reverse course.


How then do we, as Governments, reconcile our obligations to our own citizens with our responsibility to the rest of humanity?


For the Philippines, we understand that we need to expand our notion of us beyond the nation, so we can work together to secure our common future. We recognize that only inclusive multilateralism can deliver the global public goods we need.


And we believe that fairness, equality and respect should always be the basis of our engagement with one another.


Only with these can we correct the injustices that doom the downtrodden all over the world to a life of indignity. And for thousands during this pandemic  certain death.


Mr. President, the picture is bleak. There is a man-made drought of vaccines ravaging poor countries.


Rich countries hoard life-saving vaccines, while poor nations wait for trickles. They now talk of booster shots, while developing countries consider half-doses just to get by.


This is shocking beyond belief and must be condemned for what it is  a selfish act that can neither be justified rationally nor morally.


The plain fact is  this pandemic will not end unless the virus is defeated everywhere. Vaccines are key to achieving this.


This is why the Philippines committed One Million Dollars to the UNs COVAX Facility. This is our modest contribution to our collective fight against COVID-19.


We strongly urge our privileged partners to fully support the COVAX Facility and further strengthen other cooperation mechanisms. We need this to save more lives, break the cycle of variants and help ensure global economic recovery.


Just as COVID-19 has had an uneven impact on peoples, climate change has also exposed the varying vulnerabilities of countries around the globe. The risks and burden of a warming climate are simply not the same for everyone.


The greatest injustice here is that those who suffer the most are those the least responsible for this existential crisis.


But here we are now at a critical tipping point, where failure to act leads to cataclysmic consequences for the whole of humankind.


The Philippines accepts its share of responsibility and will do its part to avert this collective disaster. We have submitted our first Nationally Determined Contribution, with a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 75 per cent by 2030. I issued a moratorium on the construction of new coal power plants and a directive to explore the nuclear energy option.


But this contribution will be rendered useless if the biggest polluters  past and present  choose to do business as usual. We therefore appeal for urgent climate action, especially from those that can truly tip the balance.


Developed countries must fulfil their long-standing commitment to climate financing, technology transfer, and capacity-building in the developing world. This a moral obligation that cannot be avoided.


Our worlds transition to a green economy must not be at the expense of developing countries economic vitality. It simply cannot be  or it would be another travesty of justice.


Mr. President, the Filipino people aspire for a stable, comfortable and secure life founded on freedom, justice and equality.


We have made significant strides to this end, after more than a century of nation-building. Today, the Philippines is a middle-income economy and a thriving democracy. But difficult challenges remain  this we do not deny.


Millions of Filipinos work abroad under the most difficult and inhumane of circumstances. We call for the abolition of all structures that allow the exploitation and oppression of migrant workers.


The kafala system is one such behemoth that chains the weak, the desperate, and the voiceless to an existence of unimaginable suffering.


Nothing can justify the continued existence of this unjust system.


While reforms have been made, the kafala system must be dismantled  sooner rather than later  in the name of justice and basic decency.


The Philippines seeks stronger partnerships to protect the rights of Filipinos and realize the full potential of our nation. But let me be clear  what we mean is partnership that respects our peoples agency.


Let me say this again: My Government has a mandate and an obligation to my people. We will deal with all criminals  including terrorists  with the full force of our laws.


The Filipino people want to live in peace and security in their homes and communities  free from harm and danger from the lawless.


But achieving this goal has not been without challenges.


I say this in no uncertain terms: The law applies to all.


I have instructed the Department of Justice and the Philippine National Police to review the conduct of our campaign against illegal drugs. Those found to have acted beyond bounds during operations shall be made accountable before our laws. We have recently finalized with the United Nations our Joint Program on Human Rights. This is a model for constructive engagement between a sovereign Member State and the United Nations.


Meaningful change, to be enduring, must come from within. The imposition of ones will over another  no matter how noble the intent  has never worked in the past. And it never will in the future.


How many more countries shall be made to unravel and descend into chaos before the powerful heed this simple lesson?


In dealing with complex problems in nation-building, let us consider pragmatic approaches that square ideals with reality. Sure, they may lead us to imperfect solutions  but solutions, nonetheless, that actually work.


We all pay the price for the misadventures of the few that spiral into humanitarian disasters.


The Philippines, in line with its long-standing humanitarian tradition, has opened its doors to Afghan nationals, especially women and children, fleeing from conflict.


As one global community, we must do our utmost to help the Afghan people and all those who continue to suffer.


For the Rohingyas, I have instructed our Department of Justice to work closely with the UN High Commissioner on Refugees to prepare a cooperation program for a specific number of Rohingyas, consistent with our capacities.


The Philippines has limited resources during these extraordinary times. But what we can do for humanity and to uplift human dignity, we will.


Mr. President, in a period of profound geopolitical change, it is vital that all countries  big and small  commit to the rule of law. FULLY AND FIRMLY.


For a world without law is a world of disaster, where the weak is at the mercy of the strong. There can therefore be no other acceptable basis for global order but the law.


We must resolve disputes peacefully, as we manifested in the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes.


The Philippines is one with ASEAN and other stakeholders in ensuring that the South China Sea remains a sea of peace, security and prosperity.


The 1982 UNCLOS and the 2016 Arbitral Award on the South China Sea provide a clear path towards a just, fair, and win-win solution for all. The Award must be seen for what it is  a benefit across the board to all who subscribe to the majesty of the law.


No amount of wilful disregard by any country, however big and powerful, can diminish the Arbitral Awards importance.


Mr. President, we face multiple crises that demand effective global governance. Yet, our institutions, including the United Nations, have proven to be inadequate. The UN is a product of an era long past. It no longer reflects the political and economic realities of today.


Democracy and transparency are concepts that reverberate in the halls of the UN. But ironically, the Security Council  the pinnacle of the UN structure  violates every tenet of these values. It is neither democratic nor transparent in its representation and processes. Many member states have spoken firmly and we agree: This simply is not right.


If the UN is to lead the world out of the many crises we face, things need to change. The UN must empower itself, by reforming itself. Therein lies the hope for humanity.


Thank you."	2021-09-21
Ferdinand R. Marcos	UNGA 77	"I am Ferdinand Marcos, and I am President of the Republic of the Philippines. I stand here today on behalf of 110 million Filipinos. At this time of crisis and opportunity, I bring with me the spirit of their enduring commitment to the ideals of our United Nations.


That commitment is reflected in our solid contributions to the cause of peace and justice. By shepherding through the Manila Declaration of 1982, we helped affirm that differences should be resolved only through peaceful means. By reinforcing the predictability and stability of international law, particularly the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, we provided an example of how States should resolve their differences, through reason and right. Those two contributions provide useful guidance for our time, for amid challenging global tides, an important ballast is the stabilization of our common vessel, that is, our open, inclusive and rules-based international order, governed by international law and informed by the principles of equity and justice. As I have underscored, the Philippines will continue to be a friend to all and an enemy of none.


Our world order traces its roots to a moment 77 years ago. The President of the General Assemblys first predecessor from Asia, General Carlos Romulo, called on our leaders then to make this floor our last battlefield in order to determine in this Hall whether humankind was to survive or be wiped out in another holocaust. Our peoples chose survival, cooperation and peace, and by doing so, they made history.


Today, history once again calls on us to make those choices. We are confronted by tectonic shifts that will inform the ebb and flow of the coming century. Of those, I see four challenges to the continued survival of our global community.


The first challenge is climate change. The time for talk about if and when has long since passed it is here and now. Climate change is the greatest threat affecting our nations and peoples. There is no other problem so global in nature that it requires a united effort led by the United Nations.


The effects of climate change are uneven and reflect a historical injustice whereby those who are least responsible suffer the most. The Philippines, for example, is a net carbon sink. We absorb more carbon dioxide than we emit. Yet we are the fourth most vulnerable country to the effects of climate change.


That injustice must be corrected and those who need to do more must act now. We accept our share of responsibility and will continue to do our part to avert that collective disaster.


We call on industrialized countries to immediately fulfil their obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions, provide climate financing and technology transfer for the adaptation of the most vulnerable and developing countries and lead by example. We look forward to concrete outcomes at the Conference of the Parties to the Convention to be held in Egypt later this year. When future generations look back, let them not ask why we did not take this opportunity to turn the tide, or why we continued in our profligate ways until it was too late. The threat knows no borders, no social class, nor any geopolitical consideration. How we address it will be the true test of our time.


Secondly, the development of advanced technologies is rapidly transforming human life and experience. We still barely understand how those transformations are unfolding and where they are leading. The imminent diffusion of those emerging technologies could solve many of our old problems, but could also disrupt our political and social orders. Our governance structures must keep up.


Thirdly, widening geopolitical polarities and sharpening strategic competitions are transforming the international political landscape. A profound lack of trust is putting enormous strains on our multilateral system. The Charter of the United Nations itself is being violated around the world as we speak. In Asia, our hard-won peace and stability is under threat from increasing strategic and ideological tensions. They demand that we uphold the ideals that led to the establishment of this parliament of nations and reject any attempt to deny or redefine our common understanding of those principles


Even as we grapple with those new long-term shifts, we remain beset by an unresolved problem, the inequalities and inequities that persist within and among countries, and that continue to demand urgent action. Therein lies our fourth transcendent challenge. That injustice was evident during the pandemic, when the richer nations immediately received vaccines at the expense of the have-nots. We see, for example, similar dangers lurking in the persistent digital divide and in ballooning debt burdens.


As we awaken from the economic stupor caused by the pandemic, we must reinvigorate the world economy. We must use public and private resources to encourage the expansion of trade, investment and technology transfers to accelerate development. Knowledge and intellectual gains must flow freely to allow those lagging behind to catch up. Sustainable development will be hampered to the detriment of all if existing structures in the global economy remain unreformed.


In the past three decades, Filipinos have made significant strides on their path to sustainable development. Despite the challenges of the pandemic and global economic upheavals, we remain on track to reach upper-middle-income status by next year. With steady investment in food, public health, education and other social services, we expect to become a moderately prosperous country by 2040. I am confident that we will achieve that vision. Yet no nation stands alone. The achievement of our national ambition requires a global environment that creates conditions that allow all nations, including ours, to thrive in peace. We need the United Nations to continue to work and we in the Philippines are determined to be part of that solution.


The Philippines did not hesitate to donate to the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) Facility that helped provide vaccines in many parts of the developing world. Multilateralism and international cooperation do make a difference. Filipino health workers were on the front lines in many countries to curb the spread of the virus, risking and often sacrificing their own lives to save those of others. We have always been an optimistic and courageous nation. Despite the enormity of those challenges, we believe that solutions are within our collective grasp. The President of the Assembly has already identified the three tools at our disposal.


The first of those tools is solidarity. We need to reaffirm the wisdom of the founders of our United Nations. That means transcending our differences and committing to ending war, upholding justice, respecting human rights and maintaining international peace and security.


Nuclear weapons continue to pose an existential threat, despite our efforts to build norms that resoundingly prohibit them. We must reject the notion of deterrence and remain committed to decreasing the global stockpile of those weapons. At the same time, we must also address the scourge of the proliferation of all weapons, be they small arms, light weapons or improvised explosive devices.


Our work must also focus on ensuring that the international system remains fair, not only for all States but more importantly for all peoples. The system must work for the most vulnerable, especially the marginalized, including migrants and refugees. The world has witnessed the enduring contribution of migrants in the fight against the pandemic. We are still dreaming of an end to the disturbing incidents of racism, of Asian hate and of all prejudice


The Philippines joint programme on human rights with the United Nations is an example of a constructive approach that puts our people rather than our politics at the centre of that work. It provides a model for revitalizing the structures that facilitate solidarity between the United Nations and a sovereign duty-bearer. Our continued solidarity will also benefit from a reformed and more inclusive Security Council and an empowered General Assembly that can hold the Council to account.


At the same time, the United Nations must forge ahead with its flagship tradition of global peacekeeping. My countrys experiences in building peace and forging new paths of cooperation can enrich the work of the Security Council. To that end, I appeal for the valuable support of all Member States for the Philippines candidature for the Security Council for the 2027-2028 term.


Our success in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao in the south of the Philippines is the centrepiece of those efforts. The peace that we have forged after many decades of conflict among warring factions and clansmen demonstrates that unity is possible even in the most trying circumstances. Inclusive dialogue involving all stakeholders, including women, young people, faith leaders and civil society, conducted with patience and in good faith, has produced a credible and solid foundation for self-governance that will pave the way for lasting peace and sustainable development.


We take the same approach in Asia. The Philippines builds partnerships for peace and development through dialogue, including interfaith and interreligious dialogue, especially through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. In the face of great diversity, we believe that partnerships form the bridge that will unite us all in promoting peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.


Our global community is only as strong as we make it. We have to ensure that all nations, especially developing countries, are equipped with the tools they need to navigate the uncharted waters of this century. That requires a transformative development agenda. We therefore welcome the convening of a United Nations summit of the future next year as an opportunity to collectively roll up our sleeves and chart our common path.


The second of those tools is sustainability. We must seek solutions that preserve our plane, solutions that must transcend our time and win the future for succeeding generations. We crafted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as a platform of unity where our societies can build a future that is resilient and inclusive and where our people can be healthy, happy and secure. That requires investment in food security, the fragility of which has been clearly demonstrated by the pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine. We need to take concrete steps towards a modern and resilient agriculture. Food is not just a trade commodity or a livelihood, it is an existential imperative as well as a moral one. It is the very basis of human security.


In order to attain food self-sufficiency and security, we are providing innovative solutions and financial support to farmers and fisherfolk to adapt new technologies and connect to national and global value supply chains. We look forward to forging cooperation with the United Nations and our partners to boost agricultural productivity and food security. As host to 17 United Nations agencies, programmes and funds, the Philippines strongly supports reforms to ensure that the United Nations development system delivers as one through its United Nations country team.


Water connects our world and sustains our existence, but it is also a finite resource that requires our stewardship. Our biodiversity is equally important and must be protected amid the continuing challenge of climate change. We must enhance our cooperation in those areas, but sustainability also requires development policies that go beyond traditional metrics. We already know that gross domestic product is an incomplete measure of progress and that vulnerability is multidimensional. Our development agenda must also take into account the interests of all developing nations, including middle-income countries, where the majority of the worlds poor live.


At the same time, sustainability means equipping our people with the tools they need to meet the challenges of the fourth industrial revolution. Investments in education are key, and my Administration is prepared to make such investments. The Philippines notes with appreciation the Transforming Education Summit held earlier this week, at which those subjects were taken up. There is perhaps no greater renewable resource than the creativity and innovation of our young people. We understand the value of harnessing our peoples talents by creating a robust and creative economy, and we will continue to work with partners in promoting that at the international level.


The third and final tool is science. Knowledge and discovery remain the keys to unlocking the potential of our dynamic future. Encouraging our young peoples curiosity, honing their skills and protecting their intellectual property are important investments. Humankind is expanding its horizons, both in the digital world and out in our physical universe. Access to those domains is an inalienable right of all nations, as is the peaceful use of all existing and emerging technologies.


The Philippines is preparing for the future by laying a governance framework that will enable us to harness the power of renewable energy, develop the capacity to utilize life sciences such as medicine and virology, pursue digital solutions towards a more modern economy and expand our presence in outer space. But we also need to update the global structures that facilitate international cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, biology and chemistry, to name but a few. At the same time, we need new structures to govern rapid advances in other areas. We need to start by defining the norms of responsible behaviour in cyberspace and outer space and forming legal rules that will prevent the weaponization of artificial intelligence.


The diffusion of cutting-edge technology across the economy is promising, but it could come at a cost. Our development agenda must consider the possible displacement of human labour as a result of advances in automation. We must prepare our economic structures for that. We should start building the necessary supports for the sectors affected.


The transcendent challenges of our time are as consequential as those that faced us 77 years ago when we founded this body. We are indeed at a watershed moment, one that requires a refounding of this our United Nations. The world is ready for transformation. It is up to us, as leaders of our nations, to move and shape that transformation. The future beckons, and we can embark on that journey as single nations or as a world in harmony. I say, let the challenges of one people be the challenges for all nations. In that way the success of one will be a success for us all.


The peoples of the world look to their leaders, to us, to make these aspirations for our future a reality. We must not fail them. And if we stand together, we will not fail them. If we stand together, we can only succeed. Let us dream, let us work for those successes for all our nations, united."	2022-09-20
Enrique A. Manalo	UNGA 78	"It is an honour to address the General Assembly today on behalf of ?President Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr. of the Philippines and to reaffirm my countrys solidarity with the United Nations. As a founding Member of our Organization, our commitment to multilateralism, with the Charter of the United Nations as its bedrock, is unwavering. The United Nations has bound our nations with the common purpose to uplift our shared humanity  through the ravages of Second World War, conflicts and regional and global pandemics  by establishing the universality of human rights and human dignity, and with a rules-based order underpinned by international law that guarantees the flourishing in peace of free and equal nations.


With the United Nations at the centre amid the tides of challenge and change, multilateralism must rise to the occasion. The spirit of our Organization calls on us to respond decisively to existential threats such as global warming, degrading ecosystems, diseases and food insecurity, and to reclaim the power of dialogue and diplomacy as we manage new complexities of conflict and strategic competition. We must configure our work to the realities of our time, placing people and communities at the heart of our agenda, refocusing consensus through differences and recognizing the agency of many voices  not only the powerful few  in shaping our shared future. The theme of this years session of the Assembly frames a global conversation on solidarity and trust as essential enablers of global action. Greater solidarity and trust also arise as outcomes of shared triumphs; they thrive more when multilateralism works and weaken when our global institutions fail to deliver dividends for the benefit of all.


our collective responsibility. The United Nations is underwritten by a rules-based order governed by international law and informed by the principles of equity and of justice. Its present and future rest on the predictability and stability of international law, which safeguards the rights of all States. If multilateralism is to endure, all States must adhere to the rule of law. Guided by an independent foreign policy, the Philippines actively works with nations to promote a rules-based international order. We advocate the peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with international law. That has always been our position with respect to the disputes in the West Philippine Sea, in as much as we are prepared to defend our sovereignty, sovereign rights and territorial integrity. As President Marcos Jr. has declared, we are a friend to all and an enemy to none. Our Constitution renounces war as an instrument of national policy, adopts the generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of the land and adheres to a policy of peace, equality, justice, freedom, cooperation and amity with all nations. We recognize the role of international legal bodies in fostering greater solidarity around the values that underpin the United Nations. This year, the General Assembly adopted by consensus resolution 77/322 to celebrate the one hundred and twenty-fifth anniversary of the Permanent Court of Arbitration.


As an archipelagic State whose destiny is intimately linked to the oceans, the Philippines is a champion of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and we are proud to have been among the first States to have signed this week the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction, which opens new windows for cooperation in the responsible stewardship of the high seas. The primacy of UNCLOS was affirmed by the 2016 arbitral award on the South China Sea, which definitively settled the status of historic rights and maritime entitlements in the South China Sea, declaring without legal effect claims that exceed entitlements beyond the geographic and substantive limits of UNCLOS. For the past seven years, we have celebrated that award, which is now part of international law. Adherence to international law contributes to keeping the Indo-Pacific region, with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) at the centre, free, open, stable and peaceful. In line with that, we are guided by the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific.


During the Cold War, the Philippines shepherded the adoption of the 1982 Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes, convinced that our world should not descend again into large-scale conflict when the possibility of nuclear catastrophe loomed. Humankind remains in a state of danger because there are too many destructive and disruptive weapons now in existence. With thousands of nuclear warheads still present and the fissile material cut-off treaty unrealized, heightened arms races and new method of warfare, including in the cyber and space domains, have transformed the strategic landscape of the twenty-first century. More than ever, the rule of law must reign.


During his address to the Assembly last year, President Marcos Jr. called for rules and norms for the responsible use of emerging technologies (see A/77/ PV.5). The Philippines is working with partners to establish rules to govern lethal autonomous weapons systems. In that regard, we will host an Indo-Pacific meeting in December. We advocate the peaceful uses of outer space, the elaboration of the principle of due regard in the space domain and greater responsibility among States to reduce space threats, including debris from rocket launches. We call for United Nations partnerships that guarantee that new technologies are not weaponized or misused in any way to subvert democracy and freedom, challenge international humanitarian law, exploit the vulnerable or violate human rights and human dignity.


We are profoundly concerned about the excessive suffering caused across the globe by extreme weather events. That phenomenon reminds us of three realities, namely, that climate change is evolving into a full crisis, that the fight against global warming and sea level rise is a race against time and that effective climate action requires stronger multilateral cooperation. We need decisive, responsible, just and sustainable solutions that look after populations and protect those who have contributed the least to global warming but have the highest vulnerability by virtue of their geography. That is the meaning of solidarity on climate action.


More than a decade ago, the Philippines pioneered the adoption of a resolution in the Human Rights Council that drew attention to the impact of climate change on human rights. While we are heartened that that link is now acknowledged, much more remains to be done. We join the call for industrialized countries to abide by their obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We look forward to the adoption of decisions by the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change concerning the establishment of a loss and damage fund and other climate financing mechanisms. We thank Vanuatu and the core group of States for rallying the United Nations to bring the question of State obligations relating to climate change to the International Court of Justice. The Philippines will participate actively in the proceedings. Moreover, we stand in solidarity with island States taking part in the proceedings of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea on obligations relating to climate change and the marine environment under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.


Cognizant that the future will see more climate-induced migration and displacement, as acknowledged in the Global Compact for Migration, the Philippines and the International Organization for Migration convened a ministerial round table on climate change and migration in the Asia-Pacific region earlier this week in New York. With the Asia-Pacific Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction to be held in Manila in 2024, the Philippines aims to effectively build a bridge between disaster risk resilience and the climate agenda.


We are in the home stretch for securing Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) outcomes globally. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is well-integrated in the Philippines mid- and long-term development plans, and we can unlock opportunities for the Philippines and developing countries, including middle-income countries, to advance South-South cooperation and achieve development goals worldwide. As a middle-income country, we support initiatives to make international financial and development mechanisms better attuned to the needs of middle-income countries. Our partnerships should bridge development divides. Our collaboration for the future should make our societies more resilient, more cohesive and more humane, and as I stated at the SDG Summit earlier this week, if we work together, sustainable is attainable.


The continued reform of the United Nations development system is key to ensuring that the Organization delivers transformative development outcomes. The United Nations and its specialized agencies and funds have the duty of providing efficient, coherent and accountable support to host States, with the consent of the latter and in accordance with their national development priorities. Solidarity prepares the ground for international cooperation as we reinforce the global health security system, taking into account the lessons of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.


Together with like-minded States, the Philippines has called for equity in the provision of vaccines and resilient health services in the negotiations on the global pandemic treaty. We must never again witness a global emergency on such a scale, in which those most in need will be provided for last. The Philippines supports the World Health Organization Contingency Fund for Emergencies, the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility and other mechanisms that harness the power of partnerships to address persistent health challenges and emergencies.


We affirm that health is primordial to our human development agenda, and we are all indebted to the Filipino health-care workers at the front lines of the pandemic throughout the world. We honour the many who lost their lives in the service of our common humanity. The pandemic compelled the international community, especially countries of destination, to recognize the contributions of migrants to their societies and to protect their rights. The Global Compact is the road map for that.


This year marks the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Represented by the late General Carlos P. Romulo, a former President of the General Assembly, the Philippines was an active member of the first Commission on Human Rights, which drafted that seminal document. Following the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Philippines assumed a leading role in the drafting of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the framing of such instruments as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.


To date, the Philippines is party to eight core human rights instruments. Recognizing human rights as unfinished business in all parts of the world, we are a dedicated advocate for the human rights of vulnerable groups, especially women, children, indigenous peoples, migrants, persons with disabilities, refugees and older persons. However, human rights is first and foremost about people. In order to foster trust and engagement, the dialogue on human rights must be genuine, based on evidence and depoliticized. When constructive and carried out in good faith and with full respect for the agency of States, collaboration on human rights can achieve concrete impacts.


I have echoed the call for solidarity in fostering and advancing a multilateral architecture that promotes the rule of law and meets the pressing challenges of our century. Such an architecture demands that we invest wisely in sound, inclusive and far-sighted multilateral institutions. The Philippines supports multilateral institutions that adhere to the highest standards of good governance, equity, inclusivity, transparency and accountability. We will work in concert with other nations towards a twenty-first century multilateralism that includes and works for the benefit of all.


The Philippines has served as a pathfinder for consensus on such issues as climate change and human rights and on security cooperation. We will remain a bridge-builder. In keeping with our tradition as a peacemaker, we will sustain our contributions to United Nations peacekeeping operations and continue implementing Security Council resolutions on counterterrorism and peacebuilding, among other areas.


The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao embodies the vision of the Philippines for people-focused peacebuilding. The Philippines candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the 20272028 term manifests our strong desire to offer the best of the Philippines diplomatic tradition. We count on the support of all Member States in that regard. Fully living up to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the aspirations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are unfinished projects, and their realization is in our hands  that is our challenge. Through solidarity, we can foster a constructive multilateralism that embraces that challenge with courage and perseveres in hope and common purpose."	2023-09-23
Enrique A. Manalo	UNGA 79	"Mr. President,


In 1946, Carlos P. Romulo, who would become the first Asian President of the General Assembly said: We are not here to make peace, but to build for peace, not to reap and divide the harvest of victory, but to make ready the hearts and minds of men and women for the needs of peace.


In those early years of the United Nations, the Philippines had clearly understood the magnitude of the work ahead. As a founding member and a young nation, the Philippines committed fully to the aims and purposes of the UN.


Eight decades hence  we still do.


President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. affirmed that multilateralism remains the single viable platform for collective action against transcendent global challenges. He emphasized that the rule of law and the integrity of the multilateral system must prevail amidst the current global challenges.


The UN has held itself as the platform and pathway to address international peace and security. It serves as the ground for states to find convergence amidst crises and conflict. It offers response and relief, hope and humanity.

 

solutions, and that a better world is possible when States commit working together towards a common vision.


The Pact bridges our collective hopes and our contemporary aspirations, with the UN Charter and the sovereign equality of states anchoring our will.



Mr. President,


Our world has been changing more rapidly than at any time in recent history.


The UN must rise to the occasion with an agenda that fosters equity, justice, international peace and security, development, and adopts processes that are inclusive, transparent, responsive and effective.


One way to achieve this is to reform the Security Council and revitalize the General Assembly.


Security Council reform should be a package consisting of the enlargement of its membership and improvement of its working methods, in order to create greater transparency and accountability of the Council to the general membership of the UN.


Transforming the international financial architecture is also imperative if we are to realize just and inclusive growth worldwide. We must therefore deliver on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.


We must lose no time to implement the Global Digital Compact.


Governance of new spheres of human activity, including artificial intelligence, the internet, and outer space, must keep up with the speed and scale at which these technologies are developing. New rules should place human dignity as the priority.


At the same time, we must complete the unfinished business of eliminating weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear arms. A treaty on fissile material production is long overdue.



Mr. President,


The UN development system has accomplished much, but it requires greater coherence and efficiency with full respect for States priorities and ownership.


The global humanitarian system has been a silent sentinel of hope and humanity to peoples in war, famine, disease, calamities and displacement. It requires greater support from the international community if it is to effectively address the suffering of people in Gaza, Ukraine, Yemen, Sudan, Myanmar, and Congo.


The rising numbers of those forcibly displaced  in Ukraine, Gaza and other places, beg for a deeper sense of collective responsibility.


Within our means, the Philippines supports agile response systems to humanitarian emergencies through the Central Emergency Response Fund, the UN Relief and Works Agency and the World Health Organization Contingency Fund for Emergencies.


The Philippines has steadfastly contributed to UN Peacekeeping Operations for over six decades. Since 1963, we have deployed over 14,000 troops in 21 UN peacekeeping and special political missions.


We should bolster the Peacebuilding Fund and support UN Security Council resolutions to safeguard education and protect cultural heritage from terrorism and armed conflict.


We echo the call of the 2024 Africa Counter-Terrorism Summit in Abuja for country- led and country-owned solutions for a peaceful and secure African continent. We are honored to be part of this.

 

Mr. President,


Climate change has affected communities across the world in the most profound, often tragic, ways.


The Philippines acute climate vulnerability makes us one of staunchest proponents for strengthening climate and disaster risk resilience.


We are honored to host the Board of the Fund responding to Loss and Damage. This Fund will provide critical assistance to nations most vulnerable to climate change impacts.


Next month, the Philippines will host the Asia-Pacific Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction to spotlight best practices and solutions for the worlds most disaster-prone region.


We consistently call on developed nations to fulfill their commitments under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement.


We are convinced that legal clarity on the duties and responsibilities of States under international law with respect to environmental protection and climate change, will foster solidarity on global climate action.


In this regard, the Philippines welcomes the Advisory Opinion of the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea on the collective duty of states to protect and preserve the marine environment.


Since last year, the Philippines has shepherded UN discussions on a draft instrument for the protection of persons in the event of disasters.


The twentieth anniversary of the Indian Ocean Tsunami this year reminds us again that the rising scale and frequency of disasters demand such an instrument.

 

Mr. President,


No one must be left behind.


We must fulfill the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Philippines governance agenda aims to achieve a single-digit poverty rate by 2028. Between 2021 and 2023, we reduced poverty incidence by nearly 3 percent equal to 2.45 million people, through innovative social protection programs.


The World Food Program has cited the Philippines for being a thought leader in this regard.


As we move towards upper-middle income status, we recognize that the UN and international financial institutions can redesign frameworks to support middle income countries, which represent 75 percent of the worlds population. The Philippines will host a conference early next year to advance these discussions.


Now sixty years old, the Group of 77 continues to advocate for a fairer, more inclusive, global economic order. We thus hope that the Second World Summit for Social Development and the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development will catalyze strategic action for narrowing global inequalities.


We welcome amendments to International Health Regulations and progress on a Pandemic Agreement. The Philippines leads the Group of Equity to promote developing country priorities in the negotiations of this Agreement.


We also lead discussions in the World Health Organization on a sustainable global health workforce, as the world braces for a shortfall of 10 million medical professionals by 2030. We will host a Philippine-Pacific forum on human health resources later this year to discuss regional solutions.

 

Migrants across the world are in need of more protection. Together with health workers, seafarers were the unsung heroes during COVID-19 and the post- pandemic recovery. The Human Rights Council adopted in July the Philippine-led resolution recognizing the human rights of seafarers.


International and inter-generational solidarity make our societies more humane and empowering. We welcome the Declaration on Future Generations and we support a binding convention on the rights of older persons.


Effectively building peace means fostering inclusive societies which harness the full capacities of persons and communities. Our work in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao offers Filipino best practices for people- focused peacebuilding.


This inspires the Philippines leadership in amplifying the role of women and youth in peace processes. Next month, the Philippines will convene the International Conference on Women, Peace and Security ahead of the 25th anniversary of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 in 2025.


Our recent chairship of the Commission on the Status of Women convinces us that despite progress made, much remains to be done to achieve true gender equality.


Mr. President,


Multilateralism is underwritten by a rules-based order governed by international law and informed by the principles of equity and justice, that safeguards the rights of all states.


If multilateralism is to thrive, all states must adhere to the rule of law.

 

Times of flux and crises offer opportunities for reinforcing a rules-based international order.


The International Court of Justice, as a principal organ of the UN, together with other international judicial and legal bodies, advances the rule of law. They uphold the primacy of resolving international disputes by peaceful means, not by the threat or use of force.


The growing volume and variety of cases brought before the ICJ and the Permanent Court of Arbitration signify the global trust and confidence in their role in peaceful dispute resolution.


Member States must invest fully in these institutions.


The use of force and threat of use of force to resolve disputes has no place in our world.


The 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and the binding 2016 Arbitral Award on the South China Sea constitute the foundation of our policy on the South China Sea. The Award declares that claims exceeding entitlements beyond the limits of UNCLOS have no legal basis.


Despite irresponsible and dangerous actions against our legitimate activities within our own waters and Exclusive Economic Zone, the Philippines remains committed to diplomacy and other peaceful means to settle disputes.


We will abide by the UN Charter and the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Resolution of Disputes in asserting our sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction in the South China Sea.

 

We do not accept narratives depicting the South China Sea as a theater of major power rivalry because they all ignore what is an essential truth: all states in this region have a right to determine their own destiny and secure their own future.


This is what the UN Charter is about.


The future of the Asia Pacific is being shaped not by one or two powers, but by all states therein.


As such, ASEAN centrality stands as a vanguard of the regional architecture based on the sovereign equality of states jointly building a peaceful, rules-based and people-centered community.


Approaching 60 years, ASEAN exemplifies the agency of states working together in fashioning multilateral approaches and solutions to present-day challenges.


Mr. President,


The Philippines stands alongside the pathfinders and bridge-builders of nations. We offer constructive solutions across the spectrum of the work of the UN  from human rights, health and humanitarian action to development, disarmament and disaster and climate risk reduction, from peacemaking to peacekeeping to peacebuilding.


As the first Asian Republic and a founding member of the UN, our diplomacy has consistently pursued peace, the sovereign equality of states, the rights and dignity of all persons.


The Philippines is a trusted partner, innovative pathfinder and committed peacemaker. We bring experience, depth and steadfastness in working with the international community to address common global challenges.


We thus count on your support for our bid for a non-permanent seat in the UN Security Council for the term 2027-2028.

 

Mr. President,


Almost 80 years since General Romulos call, the mission of the United Nations remains: to keep building for peace.


Thank you."	2024-09-28
