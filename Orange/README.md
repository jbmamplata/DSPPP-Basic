Words from the Author:
This UN and IMF-sourced dataset was created as an easy-to-use and versatile source for many types of projects - social justice, 
economics, public policy, education, and more. When I posted my notebook about 
class inequality and university choice, I looked high and low for an economic classification 
dataset that I could merge with my base data, but couldn't find one - not even in the U.N. 
dataset collection. I made this to fill that need, and I hope it helps you out.

All data is sourced from the most recent info and numbers I could find from highly 
reputable sources. I'll definitely update it when new info comes available, 
so bookmark this and watch for updates.

Description:
This compilation of the Philippines' national statements at the United Nations General Assembly 
from 1946 to 2024 offers a unique longitudinal perspective on Philippine foreign policy, diplomatic advocacies and 
multilateral priorities over nearly eight decades since the founding of the United Nations in 1945.

Spanning successive presidential administrations and seismic global shifts—from the post-World War II 
reconstruction era to the challenges of the threat of war and conflict, decolonization, debt and economic inequality
to contemporary crises like climate change and pandemics —these policy statements capture the nation’s aspirations 
and advocacies on the global stage. 

Several thematic constants emerge: a steadfast advocacy for peace, decolonization, 
and the rule of law; a consistent call for nuclear disarmament and equitable development; and a 
growing emphasis on human rights, migrant protection, and environmental stewardship. Across time, 
the Philippines has risen to respond to the exigencies of each era: invoking solidarity during the Cold War, 
asserting sovereignty in periods of regional instability, embracing cooperation in the face of global crises and 
pursuing the development of international law as anchor of peace, justice and equity.
