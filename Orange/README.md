Words from the Author:
This UN and IMF-sourced dataset was created as an easy-to-use and versatile source for many types of projects - social justice, 
economics, public policy, education, and more. When I posted my notebook about 
class inequality and university choice, I looked high and low for an economic classification 
dataset that I could merge with my base data, but couldn't find one - not even in the U.N. 
dataset collection. I made this to fill that need, and I hope it helps you out.

All data is sourced from the most recent info and numbers I could find from highly 
reputable sources. I'll definitely update it when new info comes available, 
so bookmark this and watch for updates.

Note: I just scraped these speeches from this website. This is a collection of speeches of Philippine Officials 
in United Nations General Assembly(UNGA) throughout the years(since 1946).
