Words from the Author:
This UN and IMF-sourced dataset was created as an easy-to-use and versatile source for many types of projects - social justice, 
economics, public policy, education, and more. When I posted my notebook about 
class inequality and university choice, I looked high and low for an economic classification 
dataset that I could merge with my base data, but couldn't find one - not even in the U.N. 
dataset collection. I made this to fill that need, and I hope it helps you out.
